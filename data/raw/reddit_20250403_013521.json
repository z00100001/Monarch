    "selftext": "We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

    "selftext": "Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

He is a psychoanalyst, very high rated, expensive, with lots of good reviews and a long career.\n\nI opened up and am telling this man absolutely everything, which requires a lot of courage and a leap of faith.\n\nWhat I get in return? Long silences, very little feedback. A few cliches and platitudes. Information that I already knew. Information that could be googled in minutes. He babbles out obvious shit like they are revelations.\n\nApparently there is no plan, goals, no \"homework\", or anything like that. It is just me spilling the things that \"pop up in my head\".\n\nWhy am I spilling all my beans to a total stranger that I didnt know existed six weeks ago?\n\n A man who seems to be completely shocked by the feelings that I share. Who keeps saying things like \"but WHY do you feel so stressed?\", \"but WHY do you feel this way??\", \"wait, MISERY?!?!?\" (he was utterly shocked by me using the word misery to describe my feelings).\n\nThe lots of WHYS plus the surprised/shocked body language and tone of voice directed at LOTS of things I say make me feel like the weirdest creature on Earth.\n\nThe man  was visibly taken aback when I said that I self medicate by drinking alcohol and using other drugs, even though he listed alcohol and drug addiction as one of his specialties and has 8 years of experience working at a treatment center.\n\nOverall, my loneliness and sense of weirdness were greatly reinforced by opening up to a therapist. And Im feeling worse.\n\nAnd the cost is very high, I pay out of pocket and he costs almost the same as my rent, which is my greatest expense.

After an appointment she made, which costed us 100 bucks, I started thinking about how much it would cost just to get therapy. So I refused to go because I didn\u2019t want to be a financial burden to my mom. Especially not after we almost lost our house after the 2008 recession, not after she\u2019d been the only person supporting us financially since my childhood, and not since we didn\u2019t have health insurance. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help when you grew up with an alcoholic, absent father who gave no fucks about you as a child and emotionally abused you for his own benefit. Doesn\u2019t even help now when his organs are paying the price for his addiction and he hasn\u2019t changed and has no fucking clue why you won\u2019t talk to him anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t have a large friend group now. I spend the majority of my week alone. I go to class, then go home, that\u2019s all. When I have ideas and want to do things to get out of the house, I\u2019m too afraid to do them alone and when I ask the people in my life and I get told \u201cI\u2019m too busy\u201d or \u201cnot now\u201d, I feel like locking myself in my room and crying myself to sleep. I feel like the kind of person people in life go to when their first choices aren\u2019t available for them. I feel like I\u2019m only useful to people when they don\u2019t want to be alone, not because they want to spend time with me. I feel like the only me people care to see is the one that is happy. I don\u2019t feel good enough. I don\u2019t feel like I matter. I frequently find myself daydreaming about leaving my hometown, and being on my own in another city. I just want to not feel lost anymore. I want to belong, I want to feel truly accepted and loved for all good and for all the fucked up that I am.\n\nI find myself always returning to these thoughts when I feel depressed\u2026always. I don\u2019t know how to move past it. The craziest thing is that once I\u2019m able to get past the lowest points, I feel like I was overreacting until the cycle starts all over again.\n\nAfter all this venting, I just want to know what kinds of things have helped to anchor you down when you feel depressive thoughts trying to pull you down? How do you break out of this cycle? Has anyone been in a similar situation who\u2019s been able to move past it? Any input is appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "This is something I desperately need advice on and something I can't find advice for anywhere.\nPeople don't seem to talk about the fact that once you self harm for the first time everything completely changes. I think when I first did it my brains sort of went into a dissociative shock because we are naturally wired to want to avoid pain and injury and to value our lives but somehow my mind got to the point where I literally sat down and actively made the choice to cut my own skin.\n\nI am past this now, it happened during the roughest time of my life and I didn't do it much but while not taking my anti-depressants properly | burnt myself really badly with a cigarette which has left a nasty scar and I cut my arm up for the first time in the same day (I had previously self harmed by cutting the tops of my fingers before). It was such a painful time and I'm not 100% sure why I did it. When I cut my fingers I think that was because I was annoyed at myself and wanted the marks to remind me how badly I want to change the way I am. And the cigarette was just because I hated myself so I didn't care what happened to me, and then when I cut my arm up that was after I suddenly stopped taking my antidepressants and I was super drunk so I don't have much memory but I genuinely think it was a desperate attempt to not commit suicide because I felt so pathetic and like the biggest loser ever and that the only thing I could do was attempt to release the pain by cutting or kill myself. Luckily I didn't die and I am very very happy I didn't kms.\n\nI am in a very different place now but I worry that my brain will never be the same since self harming because the chemistry has changed or something and I can't perceive emotions as well as before. There's just something in me that feels numb although I feel emotions very deeply at the same time. An example though is how before I ever self harmed or even considered the possibility of doing it if I even thought about somebody self harming it would make me feel sick and horrified like a normal person.\nNowadays though I feel nothing towards it, I really want to and need to feel horrified by it again to make sure it never happens but I think then I would be horrified staring at my own arm and l'm not sure I can accept the level of what I did to myself.\n\nMy main problem is I feel like I have killed my inner child. The younger me feels like they have died now, I can't believe I did this to myself. I have so much guilt, I even hate myself for self harming. I feel like I can never be truly happy again because I am someone who has self harmed which is like the worst thing somebody could do to themselves apart from commit suicide I guess. I feel lonely. I feel unsafe with myself. How can I learn to trust myself again? To trust the person that hurt me, the person that hated me so much to do something I would never imaaine doina to anvone except myself. I feel like a monster to myself. How could I do this to myself. I was doing my best, all my problems weren't my fault they were normal self confidence problems and self control problems because of ADHD and somehow it led to sever delusion and body dysmorphia and self hate which then led to me cutting my own skin.\n\nI need someone to help me believe that I can leave this in the past and see it as just a part of my life. I need help believing that my brain is not permanently fucked because of this. I am 100% confident I will never relapse again but I feel like the damage has been done and I feel unimaginable amounts of pain for the poor innocent happy child in me that thrived before people made me feel like a loser and I started hating the things that made me who I am.\n\nHow can I forgive myself.

Now that I'm an I dealt, it's all starting to make sense, all the moments I would zone out, isolate myself and sometimes just stay so silent even in very harsh situations. All the broken relationships, not feeling any connections with anyone.\n\nThese things built me into someone that I thought would conquer any hardship. Unfortunately that is not the case as I fell into different addiction in my mind 20s and these seemed to work out very well because I actually got friends, a girlfriend, I was outgoing until I started working. The isolation quickly started kicking back in, the addictions stopped working, the silence came back, overthinking and just too much but I still found a way which was simply knocking myself out with drinks or cannabis. \n\nThis didn't work as well I guess because I didn't actually even know that I was avoiding my traumas and I lost my first two jobs and I acted like I didn't care at all. Not until I lost my most current job is when I realised I was fighting something serious. At first I didn't really mind being fired because I was being treated poorly and the toxicity of the workplace but it hit me that for the first time I wanted some permanence and didn't actually want to deal with myself because I didn't only lose my job, I lost friends, my girlfriend, my home, independence and family couldn't help much, I started dealing with lots of uncomfortable memories to a point I had to ultimately stop using the addictions to numb the pain. All these have thrown me into a deep depression that I feel is too heavy to come out of and I want so badly to come out of it because it hurts and I need to do something about my life before it's too late. The traumas are eating me up alive, thought about ending it but never had the courage to. Anyway I just need an out and my mind is fixated on one solution ie a job with some kind of security. ",

    "selftext": "Hello, I'm a depressed 20 year old nonbinary person with ADHD and autism. I've been depressed for 10 years. \n\nI recognized today that I'm at my lowest again, because I'm basically just trying to pass the time and not think. This post is about what happened today and I just need to vent about it cuz I feel like a total loser. \n\nI overslept today, which caused a domino-effect where I decided to not go to my lectures (as I had already missed \"everything important\"). Mind you, I have 6 missed lectures of Microbiology, 3 lab raports months overdue, and multiple other lesser assignments that I should/could have focused on. \n\nI now realized that I'm back in the loop where I am a prisoner in my own body, constantly thinking about the fact that I have important things to do but not doing anything about it. Instead I sit in front of my PC all day, not eating anything but breakfast and then drinking a few energy drinks and playing videogames from morning to sundown. \n\nAfter I just shut my PC off I just feel awful, even though I made huge progress in the game. I'm not sure if I enjoyed it? I think I did, but... At the same time I feel like I didn't enjoy anything. I just kept playing. I thought about my responsibilities maybe around every 30 minute mark after 2-3 hours of continuous playing. I thought \"just this next thing and then I'll get up and do it\". \n\nI finally was able to quit the game because I'm going to have to try and go to the university tomorrow to avoid gaining too many absences (so I need to get some sleep), but I'm now *AFRAID* of the possibility that I oversleep and do nothing all day again. If that happens, I'll just end up feeling terrible again. \n\nI want to make a statement that I do not believe I'm addicted to videogames at the current moment. An argument could be made for me being addicted back when I was around 13-16 years old, but now I feel like this is not addiction to any game but rather just the fact that it was the easiest thing to do to pass the time. It also gave me momentary feelings of joy when I beat more and more bosses. For example: When my computer was taken away when I was ~14, I cried and screamed. I don't believe I'm as attached to video games currently. \n\nI don't know how I can get away from my depression and the constant executive dysfunction. I just wish I could actually close the game, get up from my chair and start working. My room looks like a mess again, and it's another one of those things that lets me know I'm in a bad place. Most of my life I've been able to function with my depression and also the fact that I have ADHD and autism, but there are times where I notice I'm barely scraping by. \n\nI truly feel like this might be a turning point for me. I believe this is one of the worst crashes I've ever had after binging any type of enjoyable activity. \n\nAfter reading my own ramblings now, I realize I have to show this to the healthcare professionals I've been working with. There are so many things that I feel like I'm able to say now, when I'm saying it to a faceless audience of people on Reddit. Maybe it's because I don't believe anyone is going to read ALL of this, if any. \n\nI'm going to fix my situation. I'm going to try. I'm not going to give up. I can do this, with the right help. I even feel a little better now that all of this has been let out. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful day. \n\n- EAS",

    "selftext": "Hello all, didn't know what to do with the title but there it is. \nI'm 25 years old and I've been depressed since I was 8, I know this because I've been in mental health care since my 8th because I confided in my parents I wanted to die really badly. Ever since then I've been to multiple kinds of therapy, psychiatrists, psychologists and it has been years and years of almost nonstop working on myself and working trough things with proffesionals. Alot has happened before my 8th which probably made me feel that way, and by the time I turned 18 I heard for the first time that it also runs in the family. \nBut after my 8th more and more stuff kept happening in my life, when I was 8 I had a tough family-home life, lots of dysfunction, lots of things happening around an 8y/o that shouldn't have, by the time I was 12 I started hurting myself, making plans to end it all (all this time being in multiple types of therapy), at 13 I got put on meds, which turned me into a zombie so they got stopped once I turned 14 all the while the family disfunction was still majorly disfuntioning, around my 15th we suddenly very quickly moved to a faraway place, away from all the friends I had made trough the years, away from all that I had built up for myself, away from my home and heart. \nI was the only one of my siblings having to move with my parents because my brother and sister were older and had already moved out. The first months living in the new home it was winter and we didn't have any power, heating, shower, and all the basics, and I was too far away from my friends to be able to go over, I turned 16 in that house at the time we just had a makeshift shower in the middle of the living room, still no heating, no flooring, no one around me except for my new classmates, who I sadly couldn't connect with because I was so distraught and hurt from what happened. \nFew weeks after I turned 16 my mom suddenly up and left, mom and dad were arguing alot even before the move, but mom left cause she found out dad was cheating over the phone, dad was working all day so I was home alone a lot of the time there. Short while after that they started a divorce and one night I was broken up with over the phone by my then-boyfriend, through his best mate telling me, and to not contact him at all ever again, I was totally done with everything and messaged my ex: \"if you don't reply I will kill myself\" I know, very stupid. \nThis made the cops show up at our door at 3pm, because ex had called them for a welfare check (I don't blame him for that), cops gave me an ultimatum: \"you either go into closed-assisted-monitored living right this moment, or you stay home and promise us you will be okay and safe\" I wanted to get the hell out of the house, so I stupidly chose to go for the first option. Days later I called my dad, remorseful of what I chose, we had a 5 hour conversation with 2 psychiatrists, my dad, and me, and I could leave the place on one condition: I could not live at my dad anymore, we had to find my mom and I had to come live with her. \nShe lived at her mom's house (my grandma) by then, so I went there. After a few months we found an appartment, and after living there for a month, my grandma died, the one we lived with, my always favourite person ever, giving me and my mom a ton of survivors guilt, we felt responsible for her death cause of the stress we brought into the home. From my that moment (16-18) it was all a blur of smoking weed, hanging around with the wrong people, got \ud83c\udf47d by 3 people I considered friends, all this time I was still in full time mental health care. I got an abusive bf, let him stay with me and my mom for 2 years, got into a special school for people that left school early, and broke up with the abusive bf at my 18\u00bdth, and I started a new relationship which would turn out to be mentally abusive too, although I didn't see that at the time. \nWhen I turned 19 I went to live on my own in a kind of student-frat house, that bf stayed over 1 night, 2 nights, and then never left my room, didn't have the guts to kick him out, love is blinding. That relationship sadly lasted for 4 years, way too long in hindsight, but hey, that's always 20/20.\nSomewhere in the time I lived in this student-frat house my brother fell through a glass roof, breaking his neck and a ton of other bones, we were told really quickly to start planning a funeral since his chance of survival from this was almost non-existent, but by a fucking miracle he recovered, a month of induced coma, 2 months of recovery in the hospital, learning to walk, learning to talk, learning to remember, having tons of brain damage, having revalidation for months after that and again by a fucking miracle we got back almost all of him (he is even driving his car again now in 2025, still can't believe it).\n\nWhen I turned 22 I finally broke up with this boyfriend that never left my room, one month after that the whole studenthouse got evicted, so I had to find a living place quickly. And with 5 days left until eviction, I found a room, albeit illegal living, but anything had to do. I got to subrent from a good friend of me and my siblings, he was a 50+ year old loner so to say, but the greatest sweetest guy you could ever meet. I got to live there for two years until I was 24 and a bit, and then he passed away from a heart attack, this hit hard, he had become my best friend in a way, my go-to for any issues, life advice, the person home when I was at my lowest, and one thing beside that: it meant we (also 2 housemates) had to move out within a month, again, while grieving the loss of our dearest friend and housemate. I found an appartment, 3 weeks after eviction, I got to stay at my sister in the meantime. \nIn this appartment I recently turned 25, still in full time mental healthcare, grieving all of the above, I am now 1 month and counting clean of smoking weed, I am studying in a field I don't even know if I want to work in.\n\n\nThis was the huuuuge backstory, because the only reason I started writing this is because: I am SO done, still, and again.\n\n\nI know I won't kill myself, I have gone through it too many times to even think about it. But here I am in my own home, which is too expensive but I don't want to lose it, I have been crying myself to sleep every night, and because I am at the one-month mark of stopping weed I get even more heavy vivid dreams than I've already always had (I never stopped dreaming even with the weed). \nI am acquiring debt but also working to make that go away. I am trying so hard to finish this study so my school debt will be that little bit smaller to pay off, and so I'll feel like I have achieved at least something.\n\nBut to be honest having so much years of uninterrupted depression is really heavy, and it's chipping away at me, constant healthcare, constant feelings of nothingness, constant new diagnoses, new bad things happening and a new thing since two years: anhedonia. \nI never thought 3 years ago I would've ever said this but: I'd much rather have manic episodes than feeling nothing at all, I used to have so many hobbies, so many interests, something could always make my day or life that 0.1% better or bearable, but now since a few years I just feel nothing.\n\nBut I will never say mental healthcare doesn't work, cause I know I would be way worse off (if not dead) if I hadn't had it. Starting medication again in a week, and to be fair I'm fucking scared, but it's really needed now.\n\n\nDon't know what my goal was with this, but I'll post anyways. Thanks for those that took a long time to read this \"bible\". And for those giving up: please keep going, I won't promise you anything, just.keep.going.please.",

I am 25 years old and have been like this for over 5 years. I also suffer from generalized anxiety and social anxiety. Lately, I've been thinking I might have ADHD or obsessive-compulsive disorder. I've lived most of my life alone, and I'm totally tired of it. I mean, on the one hand, I loved being alone because it gave me a bit of peace, but now it's like it's hitting me hard and hurts me a lot. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm a virgin, and I haven't even kissed anyone (I've even thought I'll never have one because of everything I'm going through and what will happen in my life). Currently, I have no friends and I live locked up in my house. I also don't currently have a job, and I'm trying to resume a university degree that I dropped because my mental health is seriously deteriorating.  Anyway, I have a lot more to share, but I don't want to overwhelm anyone with my long story.

I had a terrible relationship about 2 years ago and when I get back into the world it seem like everyone that crosses my path is married and lying about it, just wants sex, pretends to want more then have other objectives, can\u2019t have simple conversations, small minded, everything I don\u2019t deserve in a person and I\u2019m such a good person I get told that all the time, I had guys tell me I deserve more than them bc I actually seem genuine and they would feel bad if they let it go any further knowing they had no intention on really getting to know me. I feel so alone in the world rn, I feel like nobody gets me, everyone around me has someone. I want to cry all the time but don\u2019t want anyone to notice, I go to therapy but even then I hold back on things bc I hate to beat a dead horse and keep talking about to same problem. I\u2019m a high energy person, I\u2019m always laughing, always cracking jokes, outside having fun, but I\u2019m also always sad and on the borderline of a breakdown after any small inconvenience, I\u2019ve got anxiety, and I cry alone.",

    "selftext": "Tried to post in here last week after all this happened and ironically my post was denied so trying again. I will try to change my wording and see if that helps. \n\nBasically, I moved from a big city to a smaller one so maybe I could be closer to my family and get a deal on rent. I had plans to move in with my aunt as my dad was already staying with her and he is sick and needs help with care. At some point my mom became part of the conversation and offered to have me and my bf and cat stay with her so my aunt wasn\u2019t too crowded; they (her and my stepdad) have a lot more room than her two bedroom house. Well, I wasn\u2019t even there a week before my mom, drunk like she always is after 8pm, started screaming at me and telling me I\u2019m a POS and I need to go to college and I also don\u2019t love her anymore because I\u2019m trying to rekindle my relationship with my father I haven\u2019t seen in 15 years and help him since he\u2019s literally dying. I should say it\u2019s not feasible for me to go to college as I have been desperately trying to find a job since I moved over here and now have two. I did manage to de escalation the fight but not before she screamed for over an hour, calling me various names and smacking the food I had in my hand onto the floor and all over the place. The food I went downstairs to make because I hadn\u2019t eaten all day due to stomach issues. Fast forward to a couple months down the road and everything seems fine. EXCEPT, I come home from work one night around 1030pm and both my parents are in the kitchen, drunk, already screaming about my boyfriend and that he\u2019s dying and needs to go to the hospital. After trying to walk away my mom drags me into the conversation so I calmly tried to explain my bf is fine he just has an infected tooth that needs to be pulled. Well my mom wasn\u2019t happy that I avoided a fight so she starts laying into me that I need to get a job (I have two, also I had just gotten home from work) and I\u2019m not doing enough chores (we had a list we were supposed to do every day, and did do) and the house should be spotless because her and my stepdad are working and me and my bf aren\u2019t. Bf was literally gone to work during this fight. Anyway it kept going in circles, I kept trying to walk away, until finally I went upstairs to my room and shut the door. Except my parents followed me upstairs to bust the door down and my mom immediately started trying to hit me. I defended myself and just tried to keep her off me, but eventually step dad grabbed me and threw me to the ground so mom could hit on me. I finally got her off me by kicking her in the stomach with all my strength and throwing her backwards off me. After that I grabbed what I could while my stepdad stood over me and threatened to hit me more and more the longer I was there. He kept saying he was going to call the police and I encouraged him to over and over again but of course he did not. After that I grabbed my stuff and headed to my sisters for the night and am now staying with my aunt where I should\u2019ve been in the first place. We only have a month here before we need to get out which isn\u2019t a problem except I straight up feel cursed now and my car has also broken down twice costing me over 1200 to fix just in the last ten days. \n\nAll of this I guess just to ask, am I alone? I feel alone. I feel angry and like maybe the best thing I can do is just end it. My own mother doesn\u2019t even like me and I cannot figure out why she hates me so much or why I become her punching bag the second she has alcohol in her system. At 34 years old I\u2019m still dealing with behavior that rules my childhood and stunted me emotionally. Oh and they fractured my shoulder blade when they through me to the ground so I have a nice lasting reminder that my parents are physically abusive. ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone I need some advice to get my life in order which is mess currently and I think I'm headed towards ruin.My father is nearing his retirement and he is having diabetes, hypertension and kidney issue.We live in village.I am 26 years old and currently unemployed but that is not even the worst part.I couldn't handle stress or responsibilities at all.When I was in hostel for college I quit and took admission in nearby college,when I started my first and only job thus far I quit when things started getting tough within 10 months.I had thought of doing post graduation after leaving my job but soon after that my mother passed away.Because of that I went into depression and didn't leave my house at all for 3 years and stopped talking with my friends and also deleted or stopped using all social media accounts.I was already very shy and socially awkward in school and college and despite performing well in prelims and any internal exams whenever there were board exams I underperformed.But at least I would go outside then.I have people pleaser tendency and I try to be kind to everyone and take every word others say to heart.This not going outside thing ruined my whole life as now when I am trying to move out I can't utter a comprehendible dialogue and my mannerisms are awkward because of that I have trouble with even going outside. So I can't get a job in village let alone moving out and getting in city. Also because of this my confidence is non existent currently because of this I cannot even do basic tasks and starting to forget things which wasn't happening previously. Because of this everyone around me are hostile to me. And I cannot make even new connections as they see this socially inept person.We are having 5 acres of farmland but with my issues no one wants to come to our house and I cannot do basic things. But I feel that I am not completely useless as I like to read a lot.I mostly read classics and historical fiction and books on finance and science.My favourite authors are Walter Scott,Stendhal,Carl Sagan,James Gleick,Emile Zola and Miguel de Cervantes.And I am fairly decent at financial knowledge and I have used my savings from first job to make balanced portfolio of large mid cap debt and Nasdaq funds and remaining into individual stocks using value investing principle using parameters like low debt, low pe, high opm, increasing sales and revenue, capex plans, and industries with positive outlook, etc. But can I do this sustainably for long? Also I am physically weak so cannot do heavy farm work and everyone in village treats me like fool like talking to a child or someone with mental health issues.Should I try higher education or short term course?But with these many setbacks I lost complete faith in my learning ability because everyone doubts me and reminds me how useless I am.I can't go on like this forever and everyday I feel like part of me is dying everyday.I don't want to die but feel that instead of being burden on my family would it not have been better that I didn't exist at all?I feel that I am dependent manchild.How can I sustain my life and not be disappointment to my father? Is there a path for me?",

I could just make it myself, It would just be confirming that nobody like me exists in this world, that I'm all alone, I cry. I wore out and slept in the same clothes for a week, I skipped my classes because I just couldn't be bothered to get out of bed and wasn't bothered to make a single excuse, I think I heard a mouse under my bed last night for the first time but everything sucks so much it's like a drop of water in a housefire anyways (I'm powerless, I can't fix the infestation because nobody else does anything, like everything in this rotten world), I haven't cleaned my room in a while, I was going to do it today, but it's already evening, time passes in a way that doesn't make sense anymore. I never did these things before, I didn't think I could care this little, I never understood people living in cockroach nests, but a few years of this is probably how it happened. I bought a knife some time ago, even if something bad happens there's no consequences, even if I lose another thing in my life I don't care so I don't take care of myself or responsibilities, I can just \"fix it\" as a last ditch effort if it gets bad enough, which it hasn't yet. I'm slipping away. \n\nI'm trying to be absurdist instead of nihilist, but it's hard, maybe I should just be a suffering artist anyways, just to have some kind of purpose, and stop caring about how everything sucks so much, and water my spider plant already, life is so beautiful when it's in the moment, but it's really hard not to be reminded that I exist every second of the day. I'm special for being different, I'm unique, I can make something special, but I'd rather be dead. I feel like a clown in a freak show when I try to share myself, it's meaningless without genuine understanding. I admire the founders of Angelic Pretty and Baby The Stars Shine Bright so much (a type of alternative fashion that people will laugh at you and falsely demonize you for wearing, so I haven't bothered), they were doing what they loved and made something from scratch and people loved them for it, maybe I could be the same but with art just one person who gets it is all I need, or how Van Gogh and Nietzsche suffered their whole lives but are pretty cool, but it's just a fever dream, but I have to believe in this stupid thing so I don't die or live with mice and cockroaches.

I can\u2019t shift my core believes and they keep dragging me down - how do you fight against facts and the truth. The evidence has stacked over the years and it just empathizes how pathetic I am. How many times am I going to be back in this cycle? To take two steps forward but ten back. 10 fucking years of this shit and I can\u2019t even imagine a different life.

I never told anyone about this. People say it gets better, but it doesn\u2019t. It never does. I have been struggling for over 2 years now. All I do everyday is wake up, do anything that isn\u2019t productive at all and be a burden to my family, go to sleep knowing damn well tomorrow is going to be the fucking same. I don\u2019t feel joy anymore, I mean I do but, rarely. I was a top student at my class but because of this shit, I am at an all time low. I feel numb. I don\u2019t have the courage to talk to my parents and they also have their own problems such as my dad being also depressed and my mom having a very stressful job. All I would do if I told my parents is to be a burden. In fact the job made her freaking cry. All I want is a loving family. My dad gets furious over the smallest things and raises his voice at us. I would tell more but this makes my point. I have no one to talk to. Please someone give me advice.",

Before marriage, I didn\u2019t have intercourse with my inexperienced wife.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, I had been involved with more experienced partners/prostitutes before marriage, which heightened my sexual expectations. My wife was hesitant and timid about sex, which made intimacy challenging. During this time + currently, I rely heavily on masturbation and pornography (averaging twice daily), which has since escalated to rough contents (scat, spy etc...).\n\n\n\nOver time, my wife and I developed better communication about sex, including watching porn together and discussing kinks. She is a wonderful partner, and we now want to start a family. However, I struggle with sexual attraction toward her and often need to think about past partners or fantasies to feel aroused. She knows this. We spoke about our gaps on intimacy and want to start fresh.\n\n\n\nI also find it difficult to climax during intercourse with her, though she says she enjoys our intimacy.

    "selftext": "I'm a teen with mental health struggles. My dad just came back from the doctor. I'm not an expert, but I guess his heart isn't normal in some way, and he blames it on the stress that I cause him (which is probably true). So naturally, he does what's best for his heart and physical wellbeing, and yells his brains out at me as soon as he gets home. To be honest, I completely deserved it, but one thing that stood out to me, the same thing that stands out to me every time my dad gets angry at me, was how he blamed me for using my mental health to manipulate him. I promise you I do not overestimate myself or have an ego, quite the opposite actually, but I truly think that if 95% of other people were put into my position MENTALLY (meaning they have the same mental health issues and severities as me), they would handle it worse than I do. Nobody else, not even my parents, would believe me if I told them this, because my mental problems are 100x worse than what I express, because almost all of the time I'm able to hide my emotions and keep it a secret. Because of this, my parents think I'm just being lazy and not trying in life. Basically nobody knows how severe my condition actually is. Yes, I may manipulate my parents occasionally, but that is because my body has already been completely taken over by my thoughts. Most of the time they think I'm manipulating them ON PURPOSE / making my own situation worse, I'm actually doing the best I can, I just can't help it and my brain takes over. For example, the slightest things can trigger me, like if my parents give me a stern talking-to and a punishment,  I can develop suicidal thoughts. However, if I told my parents that I'm having suicidal thoughts, they would just think that I'm trying to use my mental illness to manipulate them and get out of trouble, but I'm not. My condition is just THAT bad, so i have to hold it in. In conclusion, I'm doing much worse than everyone else thinks, which means that I'm handling it much better than everyone else thinks. This causes my parents to believe that I'm faking my mental illness sometimes or that I'm consciously making selfish decisions by taking advantage of my problems. Any advice you guys?",

Nothing that's not my fault of course, but still. I've been suicidal before but, never quite like this I feel. I have been planning a note, googling methods in some detail and thinking of plans. Honestly I totally would just kill myself (I see it as a very elegant solution to all my problems), but my issue is that I actually have many friends and family who love me. My girlfriend committed suicide about 4 years ago now, and that experience really impressed upon me just how dramatic the effects of a suicide can be on loved ones. So I'm investigating some alternatives to killing myself. I am trying to get back in therapy, but I am worried that won't be enough.\n\n I have Viibryd. It's at 20mg, but it was prescribed to me like, many years ago by this point so I'm sure it's degraded somewhat and thus isn't the same effective dosage. I have been very paranoid about SSRI's. What are people's experiences with Viibryd in particular? Did it have any lasting side effects (like even after taking it)?  Did it help with suicidality or did it make it worse? \n\nI'm kinda desperate so really any and all thoughts are welcome.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I am almost 2 years into treatment for depression. For the first year I did CBT, which didn't help. Then my depression got worse and I started antidepressants. Shortly after I was hospitalised for the first time for suicidal ideation. I was there for 3 months and tried various medication and ECT. I made multiple suicide attempts while I was there because it was awful, there was no therapy at all, and the staff didn't give a fuck. In the end they discharged me because I only seemed to be getting worse there. \n\nI'm now on my fourth admission for suicidal ideation/suicide attempts. This time I have been admitted to a different ward, where they are giving me DBT and the staff are making a lot of effort to try and help me get better. \n\nThe problem is now I feel like I've been around the same loop so many times. Every time I've made an effort to try and recover I've just ended up in the same position again, but it hurts more each time. I can't muster up the energy to try to recover again, even though it is different this time. I'm terrified of giving it one last try and failing. The staff so earnestly trying to help me just feels like pressure and more people to let down when I fail. \n\nPart of me wants to commit to giving the DBT a chance, but another part of me is just too exhausted and terrified.

    "selftext": "\nI am currently 22 and  studying in university.\n \nI've been struggling with severe depression for years now and it affects every aspect of my life and is so insanely soul crushing. I'm especially destroyed by the loneliness, I'm unable to talk to people and have essentially no friends (I've been this way for a long time and there's no quick way for me to make friends. Not looking for help in this department). Anyways the main point is I feel a lot of my pain comes from my loneliness .  (Also I've been on medication for ~7 years now and have tried every one in the book and am currently on a cocktail of 3 different ones right now, but it's never been enough.)\n\nIt feels almost every week I'm fighting off suicidal thoughts, but overtime it's gotten harder and harder. Every aspect of my life suffers because of these feelings.\n\nI genuinely believe with my whole heart that if I had an emotional support animal, it would make the world of a difference. Just having a creature to take care of, something so I'm not alone, a creature who I can love and interact with who will love and interact with me. I have been able to get pet mice and they make a world of a difference, maybe the only reason I'm still around. But unfortunately they very much are prey and although a few of them tolerate me and even like playing with my hand, theyre a far cry from an emotional support animal.\n\nI absolutely qualify for one where I live. But here is the tricky part:\n\nThe house I live in is a student house,which my dad owns (so I only pay half rent). But because of that the landlord tenant agreement doesn't hold. And so if I did get a pet without his approval, he would kick me out. ( In my city rent for a room in a student house could be ~$700-1500) And so, that is obviously not worth it.\n\nBut my dad is not heartless, I think if he knew how lonely I felt, and that having a cat or another support animal would make me feel better he would understand.\n\nHowever the last thing I want to do is tell my parents I feel this way. It will only make me feel worse. They have an idea about it as they know about the medications I'm on, but I always play it off and say it's mainly anxiety and nothing to worry about.\n\nI really do not want to tell them how desperately alone I feel. Knowing them they will blame themselves and go out of their way to support me which would make me feel even worse and more like a burden so I am so incredibly hesitant upon doing that.\n\nHow can I go about talking to my dad about my need for an emotional support animal without:\n\na) seeming like I'm using it as an excuse to get a pet\n\nb) open up entirely and change our relationship forever\n\n",

Even tho my mocks were pretty decent it's still just a meh for me and want better but every time I try to revise, I end up doing very little or just revise in the laziest way possible.\n\nIt feels like I'm a punching bag. It feels like everything is against me and every time I stand up for myself I end up getting into more shit. Like just today I was called a clown by a teacher aggressively just cuz I was standing close to a \"dangerous alley that could kill me cuz the building next to it has a high voltage circuit\" I've seen too many people actually go into the alley and the only thing that happened was Isolation, the building also literally can't do anything cuz all of the wiring is inside and it's a bricked building that's locked. Another thing that happened today, a girl and her friend group (who's been racist and hating on me for like 6 months ish because of literally nothing) splashed water on me and my 2 friends, then I splashed paint all over the main person for payback on the water and racism and now I'm probably gonna get isolation and if the paint doesn't come off ima have to give her money for new clothes and stuff\n\nI've tried my best to just accept it's how life is. I became apathetic quite a while ago and even tho I made me very chill, my life just became boring and felt pointless. I've tried drinking and it actually did help me which is why I have a drinking problem. I don't just down like 9 shots and black out, I just drink a little bit so that I get tipsy and that's it. Today I found out that all of the alcohol's gone and since then I just can't stop thinking about drinking. I also don't play any games cuz the only computer I can use is an old asf computer my dad got in like 2011. I do have an Xbox and a Wii but my parents just don't understand technology and I don't have the cables and stuff to use it. Even if I did there'd only be 1 game on the Wii and like 3 on the Xbox. I just hate life cuz everything is broken and unfair. I have ADHD Combined and Autism and I tried to reach out for help but no one did. I hate everything and I don't even care if I do something illegal. Not like kill anyone or something but like smoke weed or go to some forest. There's too many things I've done that I just can't stop thinking about and the more I do the more I regret it. I don't even jump anymore I just sit there and stare. Even some of my friends, I'm scared that I'm gonna piss them off and then they're gonna come after me and kill me. My mum is over protective and even tho I understand what she's trying to do it's just so annoying it pisses me off. I've also become more of an \"okay\" person than a \"let's do this\" kinda guy. I can't even cry anymore, every time I try it just doesn't happen. I barely hang out with friends and go out which made me very lonely. I want to be beaten up and stuff. I get pissed off easily. I just want to escape reality",

I had come to terms with my situation and embraced loneliness as something I would carry with me for the rest of my time being, and I was fine with it.\n\nHowever, in the last month, an unexpected series of events ended in my biggest crush becoming my couple. I couldn't be happier about it: She is nice, intelligent, understanding,  and treats me in a way no one had ever did. I love her in a really deep way, and want to have a lasting and stable relationship that can be comfortable for both of us.\n\nBut with that came a new problem: I became obsessed. Every moment I would think about her, texting frequently and getting super clingy when she's around. She says she likes it, so no problem there, but my issue comes when she's _not_ around. \n\nSometimes I would text her and she would not answer. Perhaps even leaving me on read for a couple of minutes. Maybe she would be too focused on her own stuff that she wouldn't pay attention to me when I ask for hugs or kisses. Or ignore me to put her attention in other stuff.\n\n And in those moments, I become flooded with very hurting feelings of anxiety and nervousness. My mind starts to think for itself, telling me she's getting annoyed and will stop liking me soon. I've had many experiences of people getting bored of me in the past and abandoning me, or even annoying people I liked because of this attitude, and I'm horribly afraid of losing her in particular. \n\nHow can I stop being this dependent and clingy? How can I accept the fact that these randoms moments don't necessarily mean she's starting to get bored of me?\nWhat can I do to minimize the pain and anxiety I get from these situation?\n\nAny advise will be really thanked.\n\nBear in mind that English is not my native language, so I may be unable to express correctly sometimes..",

That my depression is coming back and  has hollowed me out.\n\nMy psychiatrist suggested a program where, after 12 weeks of coursework, I\u2019d earn a Certificate II in Retail. My mum wanted me to do it, so I did. Three weeks in, and it\u2019s fine. The workload is easy, the content is common sense. Nothing too hard.\n\nWhen I told my mum I didn\u2019t want to work at this job anymore, she lost it. And I get it. I\u2019m eighteen. Unemployed. She told me it was this job or I go back to the certificate program. But I just told my certificate trainer I got hired and wouldn't be able to come in this week because of work. What do I even do now? I'm stressed and anxious about all of this. \n\nI haven't self harmed in a while but the urge to has been building for a couple of weeks and tonight has just exploded. \n\n  \nPlease be kind. I know this might not seem like a big deal to some, but it feels like a lot to me. I understand that life is hard and that I need to push through, but right now, I just feel stuck. I'm not looking for pity\u2014just needed to get this off my chest.",

My psychiatrist recommended Wellbutrin and luckily for me, it worked great. I no longer woke up feeling immediate dread, my thoughts were emotionally neutral as opposed to negative, and I was able to manage my day to day needs easier. \n\nI felt so much better that I was terrified of being totally dependent on Wellbutrin. I expressed this to my psychiatrist who assured me that I could continue taking it as long as I need but it is not a long term solution, and to continue to learn coping skills in therapy that I will use once off meds. While I have been/still am in therapy, I worried that my new coping skills wouldn\u2019t be enough once I stopped taking it. So I agreed to weaning myself off two months ago and have felt ok until two weeks ago. All the same depressive feelings are back, I don\u2019t trust what I feel anymore bc it all seems irrational/emotional, and I cannot focus on anything. \n\nI am falling back on my new coping skills\u2014therapy, talking to myself positively in the mirror, exercise. But I am seriously struggling rn. While I have felt much worse in my past, it\u2019s been hard regardless. Like most of \u201cepisodes,\u201d they eventually pass. I keep telling myself I won\u2019t feel like this forever. But I certainly feel like this now. \n\nHas anyone experienced this when specifically stopping taking Wellbutrin?

I keep going into VERY depressive phases and then very good phases (lasting around 2 weeks) and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s triggering it or what to do to make it stop.

I have 2 weeks to study for 6 texts but I can\u2019t bare the thought of studying, I\u2019m skipping practice, I\u2019m losing my appetite, I skipped my best friends birthday today and honestly all I want to do is lay in bed and bed rot with my boyfriend.

I feel like I hit the jackpot in some unconscious quest for personal fulfillment when I discovered writing as a kid. There's nothing in the world that has made me happier. When I create, when I look back on the work I've made, I can feel a rush of purpose like nothing else. I don't need to be wealthy or successful, I'm decently content by myself, my ambitions are achievable and not terribly outside of my control. All I want to do is write and tell stories. That's what matters more to me than anything else. But I'm losing that drive, and nothing's replacing it.\n\nThat rush is coming less and less, and I'm feeling more and more reliant on it. Back in December I was writing almost everyday day. Nowadays, nearly everytime I come across an obstacle when writing, even issues as simple as \"what happens next?\" or \"how do I describe this?\" its like my brain falls apart. I'll set at a google doc for an hour stuck on the same sentence, even when I know how scene goes, just because I'm not finding the words for it, and I'm not getting the rush from making it. And sometimes I don't even get to that point, sometimes I feel so exhausted I can't even open up a page to write in.\n\nI hate that I do this to myself, I hate that I've done it to myself my whole life. I feel like it's my fault that I'm not happy, but I don't know how to fix this. I'm so scared of losing this part of myself, not because I don't know who I'd be without it, but because I know exactly the kind of hedonistic, self-destructive life I would lead without writing, and I can't bring myself to live that kind of life.",

For over a year I have been applying to jobs and have gotten nothing but rejection emails, not even for any kind of highly specialized positions, just cashier jobs. I have all the qualifications and experience for the majority of the jobs i\u2019m applying to and i\u2019m actually overqualified for many of them as well, but no one seems to want me. I took a gap year to focus on my mental health which makes me feel like i\u2019m falling behind everyone else i know who are going off to university from their community colleges and i can\u2019t even put the fries in the bag. \n\nNot only that but i\u2019m in a lot of credit card debt. I owe about $1.5k and don\u2019t even have a job to pay it off, so all it\u2019s doing is tanking my credit score. At this rate I\u2019ll never even be able to get an apartment with how low it is. With everything going on it\u2019s been making me so stressed I keep wanting to eat. I\u2019ve gained so much weight in the last 7 months; over 50 pounds. I look hideous. I see other 18 y.o girls and they still have perfect thin bodies they\u2019ve had their whole lives with 0 stretch marks and back rolls and it makes me feel even worse about myself. They look young and lively and i look dead and miserable. I\u2019ve got so many stretch marks you would\u2019ve thought i had 3 kids.\n\nIn all honesty it\u2019s hard to think my bf still finds me attractive. We met when I was only 150 and now i gained over a third of my former body weight. It\u2019s insane that he actually cares to be intimate with me in any way, but i don\u2019t actually let him. I\u2019m so disgusted with myself I can\u2019t even look down when I shower. I cry all the time because everything in my life has gone so wrong. I\u2019m a failure\u2013and i don\u2019t know how to keep pretending im not. I\u2019m not a good student, i\u2019m not a good worker, i\u2019m not a good girlfriend, and i\u2019m not a good daughter. With everything going on it makes me wish i would have taken my life back in April of last year; how i could have avoided all of this is i had just done it then and there. But now i\u2019m here and i can\u2019t say it was for the better.",

Now I\u2019m almost 17 years old and for several years I have been suffering from terrible OCD (chaos is going on in my head, I almost cannot control my thoughts), and this is only one of the problems. Until 12 years old, I looked at the living through pink glasses, and then in the 6th grade, my former one-class friends turned my life into hell for fun and reduced me Suma. Now I have no reason to live, or rather to exist in the spiritual hell, because people around are cruel or selfish, sooner or later I will leave this life. Although I really feel sorry for my family in this case, especially my father. For his sake, I suffered for almost 5 years since my reality has become a nightmare, I can\u2019t. However, I am afraid that after death it will be even worse, in this life I am constantly unlucky as soon as I try to change it, I'm afraid to imagine what will happen if I refuse it at all. I met the books \"Conversations with God\" Nile Walsha, where God says that hell does not exist, as well as many other optimistic things. For a while it reassured me, but now I hardly believe that this is really true. I constantly imagine that for some reason (even unenchanging from God) after death I will suffer until I finally come off the sum. Often, when my compulsions begin, I involuntarily representative it, as it were, it may look, maybe it will be a copper bull or seats under water, all the options are terrible. Yesterday I got a lot and came home by stupidity, now I am even worse. I would like God to answer me, and made it clear that I have nothing to fear, but so far this is not happening.\n(I'm sorry that there is so much text, it was just not pronounced for a long time, even on the Internet)",

Im barely holding on, and it doesn't help being in these stupid classes.

They all are able to turn in their assignments, pass their classes. And me, I can't even do anything. It's so hard, i don't know how they do it. Also doesn't help that im taking the test that basically determines my life and worth next week, and im gonna fail. It's so insane to me, time is going so fast, i can't even keep up. School is ending in two months, and Im sitting here, crying and complaining about my life. I have it so much better than so many other people, and here I am complaining and being selfish. And it also doesn't help that I have no friends, i sit alone at lunch, i sit alone in class, i do my assignments alone. The assignments I can't even do because im so stupid I don't understand anything. Yet i can't ask for help. And my parents, they aren't gonna help me, they'll just take away my phone and ipad thinking that's what is making me feel this way. Like no? It's honestly the only thing keeping me sane, keeping me from literally killing myself. Whatever, I can't do this anymore. I just want to sleep forever, and never wake up. I want to actually be smart, smart enough, good enough. Yet i'm so invisible and alone, i'm so alienated at school, the kids i've known since kindergarten all avoid me like the plague.

    "selftext": "We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  \n\nWe've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an \"innocent\" message like \"if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace\" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). \n\nWe deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  \n\nPlease report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the \"report\" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. \n\nThanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.  \n    \n    \n\n******\n***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  \n*******\n\n###Summary###\n\n**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \n\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\n\nWe're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \n\nBut there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**\n\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \n\nDo not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \n\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \n\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \n\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\n\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \n\n* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it's not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try\".  People who've had \"help\" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   \n\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \n\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \n\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\n\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\n\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\n\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \n\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\n\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\n\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \n\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \n\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don't do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You've got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)\n\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \n\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",

What I hate is that my mental health only matters to people when I'm at the point of no return. I hate people online who claim to care about mental health and suicidal people but don't. The worst thing is that they think they do. They think they care about suicidal people because they care about suicide. It's not the same thing at all. These people don't want you to die but they feel perfectly fine to turn a blind eye to your suffering. The amount of times I've heard people say \"people love you\" makes me want to peel off my own skin. Of course people love me. I understand that I have people in my life who want me to be happy, but regardless, I'm not. Frequently, telling people this doesn't help; it just makes them feel guilty. I don't want to hurt my friends and family by leaving them but I don't want to suffer either. Shit like this makes me feel selfish for being suicidal at all. I recently saw someone say that they feel like they're trying to walk off a bridge and someone is holding them back. I don't want to walk off the bridge but I also don't want to stay there. All suicide prevention does it keep people on the bridge. It doesn't take them anywhere better. Of course id like to believe my life can change, but I need help to get there. I don't want to be dead, I just don't want to live like this.\n\nWe need to have help for people stuck on the bridge, not just the ones jumping.\n\n(Also, sorry for potentially bad grammar, I'm a sophomore in highschool and I haven't been to my LA class in months because of stress so my writing might be a bit rusty)",

It all changed when my mom got divorced we moved to the cheapest apartments in town ive been here for 7 months. My mom can barely afford rent and groceries ive never been rich i was very Poor growing up in M\u00e9xico until my mom my sister and I immigrated to the US so i was very Greatful to live in middleclass it was such a luxury to me. I went online after moving  because it was too hard going to a new shcool and making new friends, it was way too hard i couldn\u2019t take it so i started this online highshcool program called penn foster. I\u2019m about to graduate 2 years early, but. I gained 40 pounds developed a ton of acn\u00e9 but most importantly, I don\u2019t  have friends anymore nobody wants to hangout with me or be around me and my bf broke up with me by simply blocking me 6 months ago because I was \u201ctoo much\u201d, he started dating girls 2 weeks later. And well i genuinely hate myself so much i don\u2019t wake up a day without wishing I was  dead. I walk 8 miles a day on my treadmill i eat 1500 calor\u00edes a day i do shcool clean and go to sleep, rinse and repeat everyday i know i need help. My sister got help she goes to therapy and takes medicine brave u she used to cut herself she\u2019s fine she\u2019s normal she has friends and a life, i cut myself too my mom found out one day because my sister made a joke about it my mom grabbed me by my wrist and slapped me and told me how pathetic i was i wish she loved me like she loves my little sister ik it because I\u2019m not pretty. I can\u2019t get help simply because ik my mom can\u2019t afford it.ive thought about going back to in person shcool but I\u2019m so fat and ugly ik what would happen to me it would just get worse, I can\u2019t seem to loose weight i thought getting a puppy would help make me happy but it made it so much worse i love her but i hate myself even more i genuinely want to end my life so badly and I can\u2019t say anything. My whole family tells me im  fat and ugly on the daily, my relatives are always talking about how ugly i got and how much acn\u00e9 i have and how digusting it is. Ik im disgusting. Ik my life is  worthless. Ik nobody cares about me. Ik I\u2019m fat I\u2019m trying so hard but I\u2019m so tired. I can\u2019t do this anymore I\u2019m stuck between overdosing or cutting my wrist idk which one yet but soon i will. I just don\u2019t want to go to hell.

makes me feel better sometimes. \n\nim here bc recently i lost a job & it messed me tf up. ive been suicidal for a long time now even as a kid ive been fucked up. i genuinely feel crazy bc i actually pray i die a lot. i was doing rly good actually, my birthday was recently & i got hired & everything was okay again. but they let me go during my trial period & i tried so hard not to cry, but after weeks of laughing with my boss & asking him how i was doing, and him looking me in my eyes & saying \"well you know theres room for improvement but youre a fast learner,\u00a0***keep doing what youre doing & youll be fine.***\" then a few days ago im called upstairs & sit at this big table & they're just like \"we think its best we move forward.\" and i sat there for like 20 seconds until i accepted it, even speak, tears just fell down my face and it was so embarrassing. i sat in the car for an hour in the parking lot before going home. i think it hurt so much because of the timing.\n\nlate last year, something happened to my family. we've already been so low in life so this was like the last straw. my cousin attacked my uncle & it led to my uncle getting a gun to defend himself and my cousin was hit in the stomach area and survived. so my uncles in jail, and they say its attempted murder, so that sent my mom spiraling & she hasn't been the same since. i thought life was hopeless, but that happened & now i feel like life is a joke or a curse. my aunt came to live with us and she's an ex addict & she's homeless. as much as i love her, she makes it so difficult since i also stay with my grandmother & they both love to argue & fight. my mom just hides in the room, so i have to go in there constantly & remind them both that we literally have nobody else, we're all we got. 4 people with no job in a 1 bedroom apt is sort of a mess. me & my mom have always been the least financially okay part of the family, but we've never had to ask for help until recently. my uncle has a huge house & all his kids have cars n my mom has always had trouble asking for help until finally her benefits ran out, n we need care for my grandma so badly, i also want to help my mom since she has back & heart problems. he wanted to help us out so he's been setting money aside. but then that stuff happened, so now hes in jail, his wife has all the money, looks like hes losing the house & she served him divorce papers while hes in custody.\n\nsome guys went to my uncle's court & heard my cousins story n he had inconsistencies in his story, he claims my uncle snapped, blacked out n got the gun n tried to kill him but we later found out my cousin punched holes in the wall.. also my cousin threatened to kill my mom if we didnt take his side, over the phone we talked. my cousin has a history of violence as well so it doesnt make sense how my uncle worked all his life, even his wife cheated on him but this ruined his life?\n\nwe dont have $ for an attorney so my mom is tryin to come up with some crazy idea to make us money, but ik how life works so im just going to keep working.\n\nmy mom has a lot of physical pain & problems so she hasnt had a job for almost 3 years now so ive been paying rent, i dont even mind doing it either. my mom has borrowed $6,000 from one of the two guy friends she has for rent. thank god for good friends. but also if i had it & someone needed it i wouldnt hesitate. i never imagined we'd be borrowing money, 4 years ago she had an amazing job until her back problems started up, we had a 2 bedroom apt & i had my own room. but we went backwards & i literally hate myself bc i think bc she had me her life was ruined.\n\ni feel like my mom is ashamed of me, like her son is such a failure and an idiot, cant even hold a job. im not the best looking either, the most weird looking in my family. i cant imagine how my mom feels about that, but she'd never admit it as good parents do. she loves me so much. i gave up all my dreams because that stuff means nothing without my mom smiling. its been so long since she's been happy. weve never been on a vacation. she dreams so big & it makes me want to die knowing that she won't ever get what she wants unless i get my shit together.\n\ni used to sing, i even performed at 2 different places after a year of making music, i was a photographer, i used to draw, i even had a youtube channel with 3,000 subscribers from just doing what i love. now i play video games every saturday night, i wait till everyones asleep and i pull an all nighter since its the only time i get to do what i love. at our old apartment i didnt party or do drugs or do stupid shit. i was a gamer. my mom had friends so i could just game & everyone in my fam thought i was a weirdo for not wanting to do sports or go out, i did play sports for a bit but i preferred to work out & game. its my only happy place. so not being able to do that anymore i feel like it does something to me mentally. i cant afford to play games anymore, unless i was a big streamer or something.\n\nmy health is awful. haven't been to doctor or dentist in some years. i have so many questions in life & i feel like im so slow and im unintelligent compared to most guys my age. i have zero friends, most of my advice i get comes from reddit. all i want in life is my mom to smile. i used to dream so big & i had a dream car & i wanted a girlfriend & all this other stuff that my friends used to want & even achieved. now i pray to just get a job thats stable. i literally pray i never find a girlfriend so i can be alone in order to work harder. i dont need a million dollars or any fancy car or big house. for my kids id want that ofc but idek man. i dont care if i like my job, ive been working minimum wage jobs & jobs i genuinely despise, but warehouse jobs seem to be the best fit for me, idc about lifting heavy stuff ill literally take on whatever pain if it means giving my mom a single damn vacation before shes gone. i just want to work every day to support us. thats all i want.\n\ni dont rly want to be here anymore, but i have no choice. atp reddit just seems like a decent way to get this off my chest. if anyone is in a similar situation you got this. i believe in you more than i believe in myself.",

Lots of physical rehab and I\u2019m a chunk surgical metal now though.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve tried to do what my grandma always practices. \u201cDo what makes you happy\u201d. Easier said than done. I pursued my degree in design, moved across the country with my now ex finance and I think things were good. Something always felt off though. \n\nThis past year any remnants of happiness I had left have been stripped. My finance and I separated due to his infidelity. I lost my first \u201cbig boy job\u201d as an interior designer for a large commercial company.

I feel like everyday trying to hold it together is a massive challenge. I\u2019m doing everything I can but nothings seeming to help. \n\nI have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD and a depressive disorder. Medicated for those so the levels of impulsivity are down atleast.

If people who killed themselves due to depression were instead said to have been 'killed by depression' or 'died due to depression', in the same way people 'die from cancer', would mental health be taken more seriously?

After all, for many people depression is a terminal illness in the same way that cancer is, so why not treat it the same way?  It even changes the brain, and takes it out on the rest of the body, just as a brain tumour does.  It changes behaviour.\n\nWould this be effective?  Who should be taking the lead in doing this?",

I didn\u2019t deserve the life that I had or the circumstances that life gave me. I don\u2019t believe that the life that I had was in God\u2018s original plan for me I think that my mother ruined God\u2018s plan for me. My mother stole all of the money that my dad left for me and used it for her drug addiction which essentially left me with nothing to fall back on in my adult life, the starter pack was almost $250,000 that could\u2019ve went towards the start of my adult life and the things I needed before but instead, it was never allocated correctly and it never was\u2026my mother did the same thing with my sister she got the same amount as me with my mother being the type of person that she is a narcissistic abuser. She pretty much pushed away all of her connections and made my family not really want anything to do with her or her kids anymore. I truly believe she actively tried to ruin my life. Her abuse permanently affected me and I don\u2019t have the means for a therapist so tonight, I think it\u2019s finally over. I\u2019m going to put myself to rest and take justice into my own hands. I love this planet, all the creatures and everything in it. I just hate how brutal and cold Some people are in this world, but my mom really put the icing on the cake and created the perfect storm for me. She basically made it so that I can make no mistakes in my early adult life or when trying to get my life together one mistake would eventually blow my life up and it did. I have to kill myself because I decided to quit a job \u2026 wow. I never did anything unforgivable in this life or really anything bad bad at all. I always treat people with proper respect I always show compassion to the people who deserve it and I always help people whenever I could even if I was pretty much broke myself I always tried to help people I want a fresh start. I want a new life a new body a new family a new start.\n\n\n\nAfter my father died, his side of the family never really mentioned him at all. My grandma would mention him occasionally, but I still know next to nothing about him, except that he was making a lot of money near the time of his death. At this point in my life, though I honestly have no other options. My grandma pretty much turned her back on me whenever I asked her for help. She could only help with $400 which I was grateful for, but it\u2019s not enough to hold me over during this difficult situation in my life right now I feel like all of my resources are pretty much expended most of my family that I could reach out for pretty much put me under the same connotation as my mother and sum me up as a type of person that\u2019s pretty much identical to her. Even though my family knows the gist of what I\u2019ve been through and the type of person that I am. They still have a lot of animosity for me that I don\u2019t understand my guess is a lot of them are homophobic or something else but nonetheless, they don\u2019t really have in their hearts to help me so my mother really asked me out of all of my opportunities. I know that I have a lot of opportunities but my situation right now is really lethal. I thank God for everything that he\u2019s blessed me with and all the opportunities that I came into this life with, but I can\u2019t do this anymore. all I know is that I don\u2019t deserve to live like this or to have experience the things that I\u2019ve experienced. I believe I have the divine right to stop my suffering. Some of the people on this planet are completely demonic.\n\nI stayed in God image for all of my life. and said the Lord\u2018s prayer 1 billion times\n. I\u2019m going to judge my life and say that anything negative that I\u2019ve ever done in my life were equally deserved to the other party. I\u2019m going to put on my favorite song in my car and have fun tonight down some back road. All I can do is laugh at the way my life played out. What a horror story\n\nI\u2019ll also never forget some of the things that life has thrown at me in curveballs. Like the people who told me to kill myself. One time I was on the bus going home from school and one of my high school bullies that I always pretty much avoided told me to kill myself over and over again for about seven times and I used to never talk to that person or give them attention so weird. Also, nobody said a thing during it. I don\u2019t even think my family can afford my funeral and I don\u2019t think anyone on my dad\u2019s side of the family would pay for it. And my mom\u2019s probably gonna be left inconsolable and crazy afterwards, but I hope my death benefits them instead of bringing them down and goodbye to all of my friends that I met that are still with me and see me for who I am love them and the friends that I know no longer see",

It probably wasn't very coherent or easy to read but whatever. Thanks for reading it if you did. I just don't know how longer I can keep taking this.",

I tried to break up with her but her secure attachment style kept us together and speaking to a therapist.  I lied and said I was over it.   I wanted to move past and forget instead of consider that I might not be able to get over it.   5 weeks later I snapped and misdirected my anger at her challenging 11 year old son.  Completely unhinged.   I left my\nLove and her kids and their friend at the side of the road.      My last words to her were \u201c get the fuck out of my car\u201d.  I messaged her months later trying to appologize- She rightfully told me to never attempt to contact her again.  All I\u2019ve ever done is leave people worse off than how they started before they dated me.   I\u2019m objectively a piece of shit.   I rewrote my will and wrote her a note focusing on our first date.  And how special she made me feel.    How her touch and care was everything to me.  How sorry I am and how in my dreams I see us happy. All the time.   I ruined us.  \n\nI just came back from a forest walk.  I double looped an extension cord around a tree in the forest and rigged up a tensioning knot.   I relaxed my legs.   The effect was almost immediate.  I immediately felt the panic and my vision go foggy.   I panicked and truly almost couldn\u2019t pull myself out of it.   Truly terrifying.    I\u2019m couldn\u2019t even commit to that.  I\u2019ve been in hospital before for a 72hr hold.  It was horrible and not helpful 18 years ago.  I told myself I would never go back.  That I would kill myself before going back again.   \n\nI wish I could go back in time and calmly just stop the car when my frustrations were triggered instead of kicking the only woman I\u2019ve ever loved out of my life.  Calmly wait instead of screaming and losing my shit.  \n\nI stopped drinking and smoking weed a few weeks ago.  All I have is dreams of her and it\u2019s torture.   Waking to realize it\u2019s all gone.   It\u2019s either I don\u2019t sleep or I dream of her.   I hate myself.    I have a cat and tenants.  Normally these obligations keep me from wanting to die.   Other times I think of my younger self and try to push through.  Lately these things all have diminishing returns.   ",

I saw the CMHT Psychiatrist on Monday and he just confirmed that it's depression and autism, and put me on another wait list - this time for 8-12 weeks.\n\nI now have to wait 8 - 12 weeks for support. I don't have my GP (I think he thinks there's nothing more I can do to help), I've been discharged from the NHS CBT service I was using because of my 'high risk', and the Wellbeing Mentor also gave up on me. \n\nI have a private counsellor who I see weekly, but it's not enough. We just talk about suicide and why I want to die. It doesn't change anything.

I feel like they've given up on me and are just waiting for me to die.\n\nI need help to stay alive for my family's sake, but I don't think I can do this alone.\n\nI simultaneously feel like such a burden on the NHS and local services and so let down and dismissed by them.",

I\u2019m giving this five more hours. It\u2019s not necessarily that I just need someone to reach out, that would be the one thing I think would keep me on this earth IF it were to happen within the next five hours. I hate to say that because I don\u2019t want anyone to feel responsible and I hope they never do. It\u2019s just one of the few things that, in one way or another, has proved to be a successful means of intervention. I have a huge clock on my wall and I know I\u2019ll be staring for the next few hours, basically counting down. Once again, I\u2019ve already reached out to the few people I have in my life. I am not optimistic that I will hear from any of them, I never have in any other attempt to reach out. \n\n- - - - - \n\nThe rest of this is somewhat of a sidenote addressed to someone specifically\u2026 These are just words I need to say that I know they will unlikely ever see. But the small chance that they come across this post is enough for me to add it.\n\n\nThere is only one person has ever known when I was in this state and has been able to change my mind. I know they are on Reddit, I don\u2019t know if they know I\u2019m on here since we\u2019ve never interacted on the platform, but I guess I want to mention this in case they ever come across this post. \n\nLast year, they prevented me from following through with a plan to kill myself in real time (that is the one and only time I\u2019ve ever reached out to ANYONE for help and I cannot express how much it meant to me). I came across a screenshot of this message it as hard as it was to do so, it still made me reconsider. \n\nThis man used to be a very close friend and I valued and appreciated him so much. He somewhat recently cut me completely out of his life, but not before justifying his actions by accusing me of being a horrible, dangerous person that harasses him and his friends. He used to be the only person I trusted enough to lean on and losing his friendship and support has been extremely difficult. As hard as it was to be reminded of that, when I came across a screenshot of one of his old messages, his words (once again) kept me from hurting myself.\n\nI mentioned this because I want to say that, although it is likely he\u2019ll ever see it, I want him to know that I will always appreciate his friendship while I had it and every time you were there for me meant more than you\u2019ll ever know, and help me through really difficult times without you ever even knowing. That\u2019s despite everything that\u2019s happened\u2026 he genuinely seems to believe his own lies and the narrative he\u2019s created about me being a monster, a liar, and dangerous. It\u2019s been an extremely painful situation\u2026 and created an issue I hate the most about myself right now - that I miss you. So very, very much. The person you were when we were friends was one of the most amazing individuals to cross my path. I\u2019ve had to convince myself that person is dead and gone. And I\u2019m still grieving that loss SO hard. I know I\u2019ll never see or talk to him again. It\u2019s one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever been through. I am still completely heartbroken. I just wish you knew these things, as well as how you have still been there for me in a very different way, saving me from myself with your words and being a source of comfort when I need it the most. \n\nI know I won\u2019t hear from this person by midnight. I\u2019m actually completely terrified of who became or maybe it\u2019s who they truly were the entire time. despite that though, I want them to know they showed me true friendship, compassion, were the only person on this earth that was ever there for me, and I cannot put towards how much I appreciate everything and how much they meant to me. I am not saying I was EVER in love with them, but I want them to know that I loved and adored the person they were and their role in my life. I would\u2019ve walked through fire if you needed me to. I wish I could tell you all of this before I go. I wish I could say goodbye. And selfishly, part of why I\u2019m sharing this on this platform now just so you know you were on my mind until the very end \u2764\ufe0f. ",

Then I went back to the living room, and I was like, \"Hey, no one is home, no one can stop me from drinking?\"\n\nI grabbed some alcohol, and started drinking it with mixed juice, it was fine, until the juice ran out, and then I desperately needed to drink more for some odd reason, so I drank pure alcohol. I started to feel dizzy, moving with difficulty, struggling to walk and moving a lot. \n\nI did something bad, I felt the urge to hurt myself, I wanted to experience how it feels to cut myself, to self harm myself, I felt like i needed to feel something, i had to feel enough, I don't know why, but I felt like I needed to do it. I desperately grabbed a knife, but it wasn't sharp enough, so I went over a sharpener there was in my backpack, and I threw it into the floor violently to break it and get the blade.\n\nThen, I started thinking, so I just decided to cut somewhere no one would notice, my thighs/hip, I started cutting a bit, no blood, fortunately, but it did hurt, but it didn't feel enough. I went back to the living room, struggling to walk, and I grabbed alcohol, and started drinking again, directly by the bottle. \n\nI kept falling on the floor, struggling and stumbling into everything, I was dizzy, and I kept going back to my room, grabbing the blade again and cutting myself more in the thigh. then back into the living room and drinking. \n\nI started to get worse, at some point after 15 minutes of doing the same thing over and over again, I started talking to myself, repeating \"i'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry\" and \"I'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay. nothing is wrong, i'm being dramatic, i'm exaggerating\", \"Please somebody help me\" as I kept walking and stumbling into everything, to the point i fell into the ground of my living room alone, started screaming and crying, kicking my feet into the air and the ground, as the music played loud enough to no one heard me, and I couldn't get up anymore.\n\nI started to crawl into the floor, i felt decided to commit suicide, I had saved some medicine in my drawers that I've been stealing off the bathroom without anyone noticing, in case I wanted to commit desperately, and it was a good timing, I was drunk, crying, messy and losing control in the floor as I crawled, cried and repeated myself over and over again. \"I'm sorry\", \"I just wanted to be happy\", \"I didn't meant things to end like this\" and crying, regretting how a single fun thing ended in something like this because I couldn't control myself.\n\nI felt miserable and stupid, as I crawled, near to the drawer in the ground, until I threw up. I threw up in the floor of my bedroom, I couldn't see at all, I just kept throwing up and started to roll in the ground, dizzy and disgusted, my face covered in vomit as I kept seeing the red vomit (from the alcohol) in the floor, and I wanted to keep going to the drawer, but all of it was around the floor where I had to go, so I gave up, and I tried standing up again, almost impossible to stand up, with my last strengths, I fell again on the floor, and I crawled in the living room again.\n\n  \nI couldn't anymore, I couldn't commit, so I was scared, this is a brand new experience to me, I kept seeing my scars in my thigh and realized how there was no turning back, so I crawled to the table and grabbed my phone. I sent my brother a message \"Please help, please.\" And then fell on my parents bed. \n\nI had the apartment door locked because I left my keys placed on it, so it couldn't be opened from outside, it was like I had it all planned to die in the moment. I heard my brother hit the door with his hand and calling me, and with my strength I stood up and I walked to the door, stumbling and impossibly walking correctly, and I took the keys out, so he could use his.\n\nHe entered, saw me crying and shaking, my head constantly moving, and immediately assisted me.\n\nHe made me sit, immediately noticed what was going on, I told him I lost my mind, something on me exploded and wanted to do everything I never wanted to, cut myself, drink like crazy and then attempt. He comforted me, called my mother, and my parents came desperately from being away from home.\n\nI'm okay now, they all assisted me, helped me, it was a horrible moment. I don't know if I'll ever drink alcohol again, this was horrific to me, it felt close enough to death to me. The scars are still in my thigh, now I'm not afraid anymore of harming myself, it almost feels like they're not enough and that I have to make more.\n\nBut, I'm okay now, I'm safe, everything is good. i'm here. Thanks.",

I don't have a support system to go to.\n\nUsually it's literature. I haven't watched anything that mirrors what I read. To be vague, big age gaps, highly and purposefully illegal scenarios.. sometimes fictional characters, sometimes famous people.\n\nIt's disgusting, I'm ashamed. I engaged in consensual 'touching' with other children as a child (along with other, mild-ish sexual trauma) I think it's a means of comfort/bad coping to me because of that, rather than a dark urge.\n\nStill, I have a history of not trusting and not being in control of myself. I've had friends much younger than me. I can't say for certain I won't do something terrible if given an opportunity that aligns with the content that I consume.\n\nSo far, I'm not motivated to stop. I've been hypersexual since I was very young, porn was a constant, and for me, that porn will always end up being taboo. I feel a sick guilt afterward, like other addictions go, but I don't think it matters how I feel if I continue to behave this way.\n\nI'm certain that if I'm not a pedophile, I must have POCD (I exhibit other symptoms of OCD) but that doesn't rid me from my wrongs. I'm feeding into it. I'm liking it, and only feeling bad when it's over. OCD doesn't make you act that way. It's my fault.\n\nMy mother doesn't take my (non-sexual) concerns seriously enough to get me evaluated. I really, really struggle being emotionally open anyway. I don't want to try therapy, I don't want to get a diagnosis anymore.\n\nI'll experience depressive episodes and engage in the content more frequently.

I miss out in their lives as well? No more ability to travel freely, live freely, do really fucking anything that I like to do. \n\nI\u2019ve been hiding it all from family and friends with a fake smile.

I\u2019m only still breathing because the only thing worse than me suffering for a lifetime is putting my family through suicide grief.

    "selftext": "I've tried to overdose on benadryl for a total of 6 times. Each time I upped the dosage. Each time I woke up wondering why am I not dead. The first time I did it I took about 21 50mg pills. Something I was prescribed for insomnia. Then that prescription was taken away from me and they gave me an entirely new med that gave me pseudo seizures. Which drove me to buy my own Benadryl because I couldn't handle those pseudo seizures and the stresses of life. The stress in life I've been dealing with is that my own wife accused me of harming our 2 month old son. Even after the hospital proved I didn't she still felt that  I did someway somehow and has kept me away from him. The separation from not being able to be apart of his life and see him grow and be happy kills me. And drives me to these decisions of worst case scenario. Which I had decided to take benadryl. Taking the same dosage equivalent that I sent myself to the hospital for. I had to take twice the amount of pills due to the over the counter dosage being 25 mg which meant I had to take 42 pills. It was hard to swallow so many. I felt the effects about an hour later. Blurred vision, vertigo, numbness, weird redness of hands and feet as if the body was struggling to move blood back and forth. So I laid down and expected to pass in my sleep. Except I woke up as if I had the best sleep. Yes I was extremely thirsty but that was it. I let a few days pass. The next weekend came I upped the pill count to 60. Hoping that would do the job this time. Again similar results. However, this time there was a hangover effect. So I once again wait to the next weekend in hopes of finally ending it all this time with 100 pills. Approximately 2500 mg of benadryl. Something that should've killed me. Again it didn't. I don't know why it didn't. I'm not exaggerating on these pill counts either. I documented the amount and times in a suicide letter/journal. Where i ponder as to if life is even real. I wanted to die but something or someone is preventing it. The 100 pills definitely gave me a harder hangover effect to overcome and if I took more it more likely would've done the job. But I thought about the what if it doesn't. What am I supposed to do then? I'm already in therapy. Not just for these thoughts, but to help me get over my past from growing up but PTSD as well. Something I got from my first 4 years in the military. I'm not looking for help nor for an explanation as to why it didn't work. I felt that this was a safe sub reddit where I can put this out there. So it's not bogging my mind down. I don't need my parents to think I tried to off myself more times after the two trips to the psyc ward I took already.   I just feel alone and lost in this whole process ",

It's kinda stupid now that I think about it, I have two loving parents, a sister that cares about me, my wonderful and amazing friends. Then why the fuck do I feel like I want to kill myself? I've always felt this way. I don't know how to explain it, I just can't.\nI guess some things never change, I don't think I'll ever see the day where I actually feel love for myself. I just see myself as a failure, and I can't be convinced other wise, I have nothing to give, nothing, absolute nothing. I'm not smart, I don't care about myself, I don't care about anything. At this point I'm planning on how to start taking pills to feel better, or at least feel less uneasy. I don't want to get better, I just see myself as a lost cause, I truly am a lost cause. I don't want to study, it makes me depressed. If I had the strength I would've killed myself earlier.\nI get really bad everytime I'm asked what do I want to study, because I just can't picture myself beyond school; I've been talked to many times by teachers, family members and family friends, always saying \"oh you should definitely be this\" or \"you're perfect for this\", nothing feels right. Nothing feels like I'm worthy of. I know this might sound childish but it's the truth. I've been thinking about going back to cutting myself, the problem is that I wear really short clothes, everyone would notice and I don't want that.\nIve been thinking about drinking too. \nMaybe if I start having an addiction my suicide will be reasonable. I don't have energy, I swear I just see absolute nothing when it comes to my future. I have nothing to give, I'm nothing, I swear, the day I graduate and start drinking, I'm going to do it once and for all, and if I don't do it, then I will live a depressing life. The more time passes, the more I'm accepting the fact that I can't complete my dreams of being a singer, or leaving this country. The more time passes, the more I'm coming to terms with my death, because I know I'm going to be a failure regardless. Maybe I should start living my life at the fullest before I go, try every drink, try every drug, try everything and ruin my body before killing myself.\nIf my family or friends ever sees this, this is not your fault, I'm just not ok in the head, and I just don't know what's wrong with me, I just know I want to end this.",

    "selftext": "This is a long ass read about how I went from depressed, suicide attempt, looking and feeling horrible to feeling absolutely amazing, filled with happiness and joy and being in extremely good shape and good health and then being thrown back into depression because of the wrong relationship, which I thought would\u2019ve made my life even happier than it was but it did the opposite. Bear with me lol \n\n\nI\u2019m about 90% sure I want out at the moment. I was severely depressed as a teen, ate 5 boxes of pills, dropped a bottle of whiskey, smoke a joint and sat on the edge of a tall building waiting to pass out, fall and die(couldn\u2019t jump cause that shit is terrifying lol). Nothing happened though. I waited for 4-5 hours and then gave up. Went straight to work after that(I worked as a bartender so you can imagine how lovely I felt having to put on a happy face and act normal after trying to KMS 6 hours before lmao) and pretended it never happened. I somehow took that as a sign that maybe there is a chance for me, that there\u2019s something out there. I went into therapy because I wanted to learn why I feel how I feel and how to cope and fix myself and I spent 7 whole years, from 18 to 25 working on my body, health and my mind. I did everything you can think of - I did meditation daily for months to destress and reflect, I did skin care routines for my face, I used oils for my hair to make it healthy, I took very good care of my wardrobe to look good. This was me, 6 years after being 178cm tall and weighing 65kg going to 83kg: https://ibb.co/ycy1hmTX + https://ibb.co/p6NsGDJ8 . I\u2019ve always been known for being the happy, positive person everyone loved being around(Leo personality I guess lol). I just wanted to reach a point where I felt happy, looked good and I know I wasn\u2019t a model but I felt content and decent and was financially stable.\n\nThen came my desire which I\u2019ve had for as long as I can remember, to just have a happy marriage. So at 25 I decide to pull up tinder, met a girl very quick and was living with her and married within 6 months. I didn\u2019t mind the pace because I knew it\u2019s what I want, I knew I want my person and for us to try to make each other happy and be there for each other. I\u2019ve always been a hopeless romantic and just craved that. Relationship did not go as expected though, she came fresh out of s very toxic and abusive relationship and I knew it will need work but I figured I fixed myself, why couldn\u2019t I help someone who\u2019s feeling shit by treating them with all the love and care in the world I could think of? Surely they\u2019ll heal and return the favour and love me back, right?\n\nHaha, no. Never healed. I spent 2 years trying to make her happy, spending every single free minute of my time with her. Picnics, dates, walks, everything planned by me. Anything I ever did was with the thought \u201cwhat can I do that\u2019ll make HER happy?\u201d Because I really wanted her to be happy and give me back the same. Did I ever get appreciation, gratitude, a thank you for anything? Nope, the entire time all I ever got was told that it was ok but I could\u2019ve done more or could\u2019ve done it differently. Comparisons to what other men do for their women which is dumb because watching cute TikTok videos and thinking that\u2019s how relationships actually are 24/7 is stupid, we all know social media shows nothing but the good moments and they emphasise and do things for the sake of the post. Nonstop criticism that I can\u2019t communicate my feelings when the issue was I did but she never actually cared to change her behaviour which led me to close off eventually. Nonstop accusations of cheating and doing shit which I did not do(to give an example, I had to send pics of where I was on my way home if I was 10min late due to traffic because she thought I\u2019m hooking up, if I didn\u2019t reply for 15+min at work it was a fight because she couldn\u2019t comprehend I have to WORK, she got mad because female cashiers would say thanks have a nice day and I\u2019d reply \u201cthanks, you too\u201d cause apparently I was supposed to just walk away in silence. Couldn\u2019t watch meme videos with women because she\u2019d get mad. If I met a friend randomly and we talked for 30-45min and I didn\u2019t reply I\u2019d get hell for it because it\u2019s unacceptable to not pull your phone out and text your partner nonstop while talking to somebody face to face. Lots more but you get the idea lol). She never worked, I worked overtime nonstop to make enough to support us both. I helped clean, cook, do laundry at home after she sat in the bed the whole day and I still didn\u2019t do enough. Sexually, I was taking a lighter version of viagra to satisfy her high libido which absolutely led to health issues I haven\u2019t diagnosed yet but I can feel my heart is fucked. Constantly told me she\u2019s never had sex better than with me but at the same time also complained that it\u2019s not enough and she needs MORE, meanwhile was I being satisfied back? Nope, lol. Everything I did was always met with criticism and negativity and she knocked me down to the point where I started doubting if I\u2019m actually a decent human like I thought I was.\n\nNow I don\u2019t anymore. After years of listening that I\u2019m not enough, don\u2019t do anything right and am shit, I believe it. Apparently I\u2019m just the worst person on the planet. I\u2019m now severely depressed, completely bankrupt and have no way out(I\u2019ve tried looking for different work or extra work but due to lack of experience or proper education I can\u2019t really do anything, can\u2019t pay for extra education either because I\u2019m bankrupt now lol). I don\u2019t see a point in living anymore. Everyone who\u2019s depressed is told to do pretty much everything I did to recover and it is fucking EXHAUSTING both mentally and psychically to go through that and heal. I did it. I was happier than ever in my life before. Now I\u2019ve been knocked back down to a worse spot than I ever was before in my life.\n\nSo what is the point? I don\u2019t see one anymore. I\u2019m a guy, I don\u2019t have friends to talk to about these things and anyone I ever had was cut off because she would never accept me talking to friends instead of being with her 25/7. There\u2019s absolutely 0 reasons for me to keep going because even if I do, it\u2019s gonna be another 5-8 years of nothing but struggle and pain and for what? For the same thing to potentially happen again? lol",

I wanna see if cutting helps relieve this, and I dont wanna tell my therapist either. not much of a point to me. just want control I guess since I havent had any resemblance of control in my life. not my life if its that case too. I used to worry about how the body will be found but that really wont pertain to me anyways once its all gone. I just feel this strong feeling of giving up. helpless and unable. no way out. Im trying to reach out this way but I dont know if it will help either, its a shot in the dark. I would love to think a 3rd psych ward visit would help but I only find surface level comfort in that compared to none at all out here. meds dont do it, therapy doesnt do it, trying to have a support system isnt cutting it either. exhausted all my options & Im left with what I see as no way out besides stopping it. I dont know. I just wanna be dead for a few days at least and rot in one place. dont know how I would wanna live after that though since doing nothing would = future repercussion. ",

I can\u2019t finish my thesis I just can\u2019t find motivation to do it because being a biologist is a death sentence in Mexico or literally a miserable job if you try to protect or manifest any concern. \n\nI can\u2019t deal with my family because my father is a moron who only cares for himself and is only willing to spend on himself all of my fucking LIFE, NO FUCKING ALIMONY FOR MY FIRST 10 YEARS OF LIFE AND THEN ONLY PAYING BARE MINIMUM WHILE HE GETS LIMITED EDITION CARS AND MOTORCYCLES AND TRIPS AROUND THE WORLD WHICH OBVIOUSLY DOESNT INCLUDE ME OR MY SISTER BUT IT DOES ITS NEW FAMILY (OH YEAH ALSO HIS FAVORITE PHRASE THAT I RECALL ALL MY CHILDHOOD IS \u201cARE YOU FUCKING STUPID, MENTALLY RETARDED OR WHAT?\u201d). \n\nMy sister is just a dumb bimbo that of course gets to be lucky on so many things, from getting a better treatment of my parents because she \u201cneeds more help\u201d to marrying a guy whose family is rich, and that she always have manage to make me a shadow  and relegated to you are older you just should let it go. \n\nTHEN MY fucking half-brother go is just a drunk VERY VERY VERY ENTITLED LITTLE FUCK because unlike mine his father gives him 800 dollars that he uses only for himself, not to help pay the internet, gas or light that he always leaves up at night, just for his alcohol, expensive clothes IM TALKING 500 tshirts and his games, and despite just turning 18 HE CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOU DON\u2019T KNOW A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE HE DOES AND IF YOU TRY TO PROVE HIM WRONG YOU ARE INVALIDATING HIS FEELINGS AND GIVING HIM ANXIETY, MF CANT EVEN WAKE HIMSELF UP TO COLLEGE HE HAS TO ASK MY MOTHER TO TRY FOR 10 MINUTES AND BY TREATING HIM AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE. \n\nAnd that leds me to my mother who I love so much and I\u2019m so grateful that she could provided me with a very good life BUT NEVER ON HER LIFE HAS SHE EVER BEEN WRONG and I can\u2019t tell her that maybe one of the reasons that my father hates us is because she cheated on him and found out because of child me, THAT SHE ALSO BADMOUTHED MY FATHER ALL MY CHILDHOOD (deserved but still won\u2019t accept it) and I HAVE TO BE A FUCKING INTERMEDIARY FOR WHEN SHE AND MY BROTHERS (WHO IF IM NOT CLEAR REALLY DONT LIKE LET ALONE LOVE) just because when she and I got to a fight she kicked out of the house but later CLAIMED AND STILL SUSTAINS THAT I WAS THE ONE TO ABANDON HER but she even make me pack my things TO GO LEAVE WITH MY FATHER THE MAN THAT CLEARLY DOESNT REALLY LIKE ME for 2 years until she and I calm over decided to try to patch things up. And every argument you try to have is just a \u201cNo, I my our mother I\u2019m allowed to interrupt you and shush when I like BUT GOD FORBIDS IF YOU DO IT\u201d. But I DO LOVE her even if she is manipulative (Oh yeah she gifted the only true gift that my father had truly got for me a bike to her PADDLE INSTRUCTOR WHO SHE KNEW FOR 2 WEEKS because according to her he needed it more, and try to gaslight me into thinking that it got stolen because literal quote I wouldn\u2019t get how of a nice thing it was to gift that and she could buy me a new one). But I was never hungry always went to a private school, I have luxury\u2019s like gaming console and a pretty good house, so I REALLY IM GREATFUL but for example I got a new job that pays me well and is mainly import data so all the day in my computer but If tell her that I\u2019m tired or anything she just tells me that why I\u2019m not doing anything to exhausting like her I\u2019m just al day in the computer and charging a lot of money for that. So yeah I never can be enough \n\nI can\u2019t go to my friends because my oldest and formerly best friends preferred his ex, who used to humiliate me and exclude me from everything like I was an alien, and it really hurt me to see him side me of like that.\nMy other friends have honestly a worse or similar situation at home. Or my best friend now being a girl who I adore as the sister I wish I had but she decided to leave to another state for a job so I don\u2019t want to bother her.\nBeing single for 12 years now, being rejected 3 times and not being really that sociable, also not being ugly but I know I\u2019m not good looking try dating apps for months not a single match, my only way to have sex after 12 years was to hire an escort which makes me fill more of a loser because I couldn\u2019t even get hard inside of her, I HAVE BECOME SO ADDICTED TO MASTURBATION AND PORN THAT I NEEDED A FUCKING TIGHT AND XTREME HAND TO FINALLY CUM.\n\nI\u2019m disgusted with my self, I HATE THAT DESPITE HAVING A GOOD LIFE I CAN ONLY WISH TO DIE TO GET A FUCKING CAR TO ROLE ME OVER because when I confess to try to suicide my mother threatened to take her life as well. I JUST WANT IT TO END I JUST WANT TO NOT THINK ANYMORE to just stayed a sleep for ever just want to not be bother to let my self truly rest to not worry how much I have to pay how I\u2019m going to leave what I\u2019m going to do and why I can\u2019t be happy WHY I JUST HATE MY SELF MORE FOR NOT BEING FUCKING HAPPY there are people whose lives are worse who don\u2019t have a roof WHY IM SUCH A FUCKING USELESS PIECE OF SHIT THAT IS NOT SATISFIED. So just help me decide which is the most accurate way to kill my self I made my research a shot to the side of the head is a result 80% in fatal injury but I\u2019m really scared of that 20%. 20% is a lot I already hate my life I don\u2019t want to end up a vegetable more of a liability to my mother more a chore I just want to make sure I die.",

Life is just repeating all over again, like a circle, no changes, nothing new, just same old life, I\u2019m getting sick of it\n\nAll I wanted was what I thought I wanted, I don\u2019t even want it, I never did so why did I even try, I\u2019m not regretting my decision, instead im confused, because I told myself I would be happy if I stopped obsessing over that guy, yet seeing him making more progress with his crush makes me so incredibly miserable, yet why am I? I like another guy now so why am I so attached to him? I hated that, so I avoided everything including him, it made me feel better, but eventually I will get tired of avoiding, why do I have to this just to move on. I want to hate him, his friends, his family and every one else linked to him but that\u2019s not fair on them, it\u2019s not his fault, or their fault, it has nothing to do with them, I wanted to be better than that so I stopped being a loser, I try in school now, I make friends, and I talk, much more, to everyone and to my parents, I was happy, I think, I should be, if not then what should I feel? Why do I feel like I haven\u2019t changed at all, why do I still feel so incredibly lonely and useless, even though I made a life for myself to live in for once, but now I don\u2019t want to live in it, I want to go back to being the spectator of life, not involved at all, I was happier back then but I hated everyone, my family, my friends, even strangers on the street I hated, I could imagine a million scenarios of them being hurt in some way possible, i hated myself too, more than anything, I don\u2019t want to go back to how I was but I also do, loving people and myself is so tiring, it\u2019s almost impossible, and for me to tire myself so much just for what? Nothing? No changes? No feelings or anything? Anything is fine, just any change in my life, make me see that I have made progress for myself and didn\u2019t waste my time, I didn\u2019t just do all that for nothing, sure my parents are happy, my friends are worrying less for me and I can see a future for myself where I don\u2019t end up dead or homeless anymore, but I still can\u2019t feel or see anything that has changed in my life\nWhat should I feel? Angry? Sad? Happy? Disgusted? Disappointed?\nPerhaps I do feel something,\nAbsolute hopelessness and incompetent, I can\u2019t even make a change in my own life, how can I want to live in it",

I chalked it up to him struggling with the idea of his mom dating again. \n\nBut last week, he made some really awful comments about my boyfriend\u2019s race, things I won\u2019t repeat here, but they shocked me to my core. He then proceeded to call me a \"mudshark\".\n\nAt first, I thought maybe he was just repeating something he heard online or from friends, but when I called him out on it, he doubled down. He started saying things about how I \"shouldn\u2019t be with him,\" making disgusting assumptions, and acting like he was somehow less because of his skin color. I was *furious, actually more than that, I was devastated.  \n\nWhere is this coming from? His father and I never raised him to think this way. His dad is white like me, but I never saw him as racist when we were together. Could this be coming from his friends? The internet? I feel like I\u2019ve failed as a parent.  \n\nI sat him down and told him in no uncertain terms that this kind of talk is unacceptable in my home. That if he thinks this way, we need to have a serious discussion about why. I want to believe this is just teenage rebellion or ignorance, but what if it\u2019s deeper than that?  \n\nI love my son, but I also love my boyfriend, and I refuse to tolerate hate in my life.

Eventually, he did mingle in the group and with me and my friend Jenna more because we all liked Dark and Stranger Things. Eventually we started talking more and more on and off office-time and going together to events such as movies, stand up comics as they all were in our mutual interests.\n\nEventually, I started developing feelings for him and did tell him this after like 7 months he joined the office, and he was relieved as he felt the same way - but didn\u2019t know how to tell me as he has never been in a relationship before. Neither had I, but I took a leap of faith as he really was a good human being, and he wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly - so I felt safe around him along with being attracted to him.\n\nSo we started dating, but my state barred any touch interactions for a first few weeks, as I was treading in an situation I\u2019ve never been in, with us holding hands at our 2 month anniversary. \n\nSimilarly our first cheek kiss was on our 6 month anniversary - and our first real kiss way past a year of us dating. Eventually him and I reached the \u201choneymoon\u201d period since him and I couldn\u2019t keep our hands off of one another (with him also being extra careful in holding and touching me - making sure I\u2019m comfortable every step of the way and asking questions like \u201cWould it be alright if I did X \u201c or \u201cDid you like it?\u201d) but I couldn\u2019t be intimate with him - no mattered how much I wanted to, or how I tried - my body just wouldn\u2019t let itself relax if even a slightest advance toward sex was made by any one of us.\n\nHe was very supportive of me regarding this - and u have to say - he put up with my condition like a champ.\n\nWe got married after 2 Years of Dating. And I began therapy around the same time I did - both couples and individual. \n\nAt no point did he forced me or insisted on continuing the moment I said to stop, and I love him for that because I feel Safe and protected when I\u2019m with him. And after a year of marriage, and 3 years total after we met - today - we made love to one another.\n\nI surrendered to him and I have never felt so close to him and the way he tenderly made me feel cared for and made me climax - all while being fully vulnerable with him just made me cry. He held on no matter what and took it slow and steady over the span of nearly 5 hours.\n\nI love him. I\u2019m his. And he\u2019s mine. And I finally am able to be myself with him.

    "selftext": "NSFW tags for suicide/ideation triggers\n\nToday I am very proud of my husband. He's a graphic designer. He's been working for a company for many years now. It was going well until about three years ago, when his new manager started a brutal, targeted and systematic breaking of his spirit. That's the best way I can explain it.\n\nHe is yelled and sworn at every day. Everything is blamed on him, even for things from other departments where he had nothing to do with it. He would be blamed, screamed at, called stupid, treated like a dog. In the many instances where it came out later that he wasn't to blame, he never got an apology. He's been told he's not allowed to talk to the other staff or listen to music while he works. The manager even keeps their shared office space at frigid temperatures, and laughed at him and called him a snowflake when he asked for the AC be turned up. Heatwaves were happening outside, 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) weather and he was inside wearing hoodies and a beanie.\n\nHe was even called the r-word the other day. That day he came home crying and went straight to bed. The manager regularly made mistakes and then blamed them on him or threw him under the bus, again never apologising or taking accountability. He is given instructions from his boss, and then contradictory instructions from his manager. When he spoke up saying the boss told him to do something else, he'd be yelled at like, \"just do what I fucking told you.\" These instructions were never in writing, and then he'd get yelled at when for doing the wrong thing with no way to prove it. If he said the manager told him to do that, the manager denied it.\n\nAs a person in a creative profession, he had a folder saved on his work computer called his \"idea folder.\" One day he was getting ready to pitch a few designs to his boss, but saw his manager swoop in with ideas of his own. They were identical to my husband's, and he then found his idea folder deleted from his computer and even removed from the recycle bin. I know this manager stays late in the office every day, at least until 9pm, watching youtube videos. I can only imagine that's when he did this. My husband had no way to prove that his ideas had been stolen, but this was just one in a very long list of abuses he suffered.\n\nWhen he went to HR, who was friendly with the manager, he was told it's \"your word against his'\" and once when he had recorded evidence of how the manager spoke to him, the manager turned it around and made a big stink about how he was \"recorded without his consent'\" so again, HR did nothing.\n\nIt got to the point that he was suicidal and planning to make things official. I recently got a new job that allows my husband to resign and stay home and look for new work without stress or rushing. But one day he gave me all of his passwords... and I got scared. I told him my greatest fear was that I'd get a call from his office one day telling me that they'd found him in the bathroom. He immediately broke down and admitted that that was his plan, because he didn't want me to be the one to find him. He was only waiting \"for me to be okay\" and settled in my new job, when I wouldn't need him anymore, and his death would not impact my life.\n\nI told him to resign as soon as my probation period was over. There are still 2 months to go, but I am settled and part of big company decisions, so I'm secure in my future job security. I told him again, \"just quit and come home.\" He said he would wait the next 2 months out. But I think the wait made it worse. Like it was so close that it felt further away. Over the last month I've watched his mental health decline rapidly. He already barely sleeps, is a twig from losing so much weight over the last 3 years, barely eats.\n\nThen yesterday happened. His boss was talking to him about a project for a big client, and the manager was badgering him in his other ear at the same time. He put his hand up and said \"please \\[manager\\], just give me five minutes to listen to what \\[boss\\] is saying.\" The manager responded with \"don't put your hand in my face, I'll fuck you up.\"\n\nMy husband,\u00a0this brave, strong, funny, kind, wonderful man of mine, my best friend, stood up to his bully, and quit on the spot. The boss ran after him, begged him to stay, and told him the manager is emigrating at the end of May. My husband told him he can't work with him anymore. He said \"do you know that I don't need this job? Yesterday my wife cleared more on her own than both of our old salaries combined, I can be a house husband if I want, I don't need you.\" He says the boss looked very worried, and more so when he explained some of his grievances, and told him that not a single employee is happy. The boss actually said \"I'd better talk to my staff before I have no more staff left.\"\n\nWhen he walked back in the office after cooling off for 10 minutes, he said \"do you think you can threaten me?\" to the manager, who responded, \"What are you going to do about it?\" My husband said he could lay a charge of threatened assault. The manager said \"sure, go ahead.\" SO HE DID LOL. My husband left the office and stopped by the police station to press charges. After that, the boss called him and asked him to come in later this week so they can discuss his future.\n\nI just wanted to make this post to share how proud I am of him. He's come home crying every day for months, he's slammed doors and punched the walls, often coming home at lunch just to have a 20-minute break away from there, to see me and cry before having to go back. He was afraid to tell me but I'm glad he did.\n\nI'm so proud of him. He stood up, fought for himself, and showed a weak man what weakness really looks like.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nYou can call me smile, I recently learned that I only have a couple of years left due to some health issues I was dragging since I'm a child. Now I always knew that I would die young but never see 30 ouch. The good side of it is I have a lot of money I could retire tomorrow without an issue.\n\nI'm currently very lost, should I close or sell my businesses? Should I just say fuck it and travel alone around the world for my remaining time? I really don't know what to do. I don't have any family left, I got very complicated relationships with my parents and only close to my grandparents that don't have much time left themselves. I have employees on the payroll and they all need it for different reasons. \n\nI wish that I could disappear and the problem will be closed nobody will suffer from seeing me slowly go away. I guess I used all my luck in the business part of my life. I lost the love of my life a couple years ago and in still struggling with it. Idk why it's so easy to throw this in there to talk to the few people I'm closed to irl. Nobody knows I don't know how to tell them....\n\nI really want to get out there see things. But I'm stuck in responsibility, too much people count on it. So is it really my way out? Work myself to the grave? If it's for the greater good why not huh? Idk I'm loosing my mind over this. What am I than a guy that got lucky only in one part of his life. I needed more time, but everything comes to an end. My end is too close for my liking. \n\nI'm trying to figure things out on my own, I did my will last week. It was a special experience when you know that it's gonna happen soon. Ahahaha I guess I still have my humor sense. I still wake up everyday and put that smile I'm known for on those lips and shine through the day. I'm gonna miss do much.\n\nMy message to the world is love, friendship, family, etc. Should be appreciate, you never know when it will end, you never know what tomorrow is made from. Take that from a guy that lost everything except money. Money can't buy happiness if you're alone to count it. \n\nPs: All people messaging me for money will be block instantly. Also English is not my first language so sorry if I made mistake.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Warning: I describe some horribly gory things I saw. I don\u2019t go into a ton of detail but it\u2019s enough I wouldn\u2019t want to read about it. I marked these with spoilers. Post should still make sense without knowing exactly what I saw. \n\nI check Instagram and TikTok a few times a day between work to release a little stress and find some comic releif, maybe learn something interesting.\n\nI\u2019ve seen some occaisional of girls because of meme pages. If the pages promote of girls a lot I unfollow. If it comes up on my feed from a page I don\u2019t follow, I select the \u201cdon\u2019t show me content like this\u201d option. Idk if that\u2019s what it says exactly but that\u2019s what it means.\n\nAlso seen the occaisional wild animal gore videos. I hate them. I understand it\u2019s wild animals nobody is doing anything wrong. I get that. I just absolutely hate seeing it. It makes me sick and uncomfortable. \n\nI\u2019ve kept my Instagram pretty clear of this stuff. But Instagram will always find ways to show you things especially poorly clothed women. I\u2019m fond just ignoring it. To be clear I have nothing against sec workers. I just don\u2019t beleive porn is good for me. I try to avoid it as much as possible these days. I behave exactly the same on TikTok and you couldn\u2019t find anything close to nudity or gore on my fyp if you scrolled for hours.\n\nIn January, it started with a video of a car crash. Don\u2019t remember it well just remember it was a crazy crash. I watched it a few times just thinking \u201c damn that shit is wild \u201c \n\nLater, maybe that day, maybe another day, I see a video gruesome video of >! A woman being stoned by what I assume is the cartel !< \u2026 \n\nit made me feel hollow and also nauseous. It even made me a little dizzy seeing it. But for some reason I couldn\u2019t look away. I felt disgusted not only from the video but also myself for not being able to look away. I think I was in shock. There was no warning whatsoever for graphic content. And it had tens of thousands of likes already.  I asked Instagram not to show me posts like that and also reported it and blocked the account. \n\nI remember that night, scrolling through Instagram. This one a video of >! Someone who was shot in the head and still alive after. His face was completely gone. Could make out some teeth and jaw pieces idk !< i felt worse watching the first one for some reason. I think because it happened to a woman but idk, this one made me think about myself more though. About how I could die at any moment. In the blink of an eye. Made me so anxious. Again - don\u2019t show me this content. Report. Block.\n\nI tried Instagram again a few days later after that thinking it was just a weird thing that Instagram fixed. Immediately see a compilation of car crashes that definitley had deaths. No chance of survival. Nothing graphic that you can see but I know what was happening. And again I could not look away. \n\nDon\u2019t show me posts like this - report - block. \n\nThe next video was >! A man that was caught in a machine. It did things to his body I couldn\u2019t have imagined !< again I couldn\u2019t look away. I don\u2019t report this time. I just scroll to see something to bleach my eyes but I just keep getting videos like this with ads and memes in between. And I go down this rabbit hole of watching these videos every day. \n\nI stop trying to avoid them. I don\u2019t like go looking for them. But I know they are going to show up and I do it anyway. Rarely ever a warning. Warnings didn\u2019t matter at this point the damage was done. I spent the next two months seeing about 4-5 death videos every day x sometimes definitley more.\n\nI hated seeing them every time but I just had this overwhelming sense of dread and fear and complete horror that was controlling me like some sort of drug. To be clear I hated every single one I saw. I had absolutely no pleasure from it. I simply just couldn\u2019t look away whenever I saw it. I started thinking about it when I wasn\u2019t seeing them. And started to have dissociative episodes x I felt horrible. I was having nightmares every single night. \n\n>! People getting stuck in machines, car crashes, murders, people falling off cliffs, someone being blown up, someone eaten by a gator, !< you name it.\n\nFinally one day I just snapped out of it. I got rid of Instagram. I went outside every day, made sure I hit the gym. Are healthy. Spent more time with friends. Everything to get my mind off of that shit. \n\nIt worked for about a week. Then the guilt hit, and the dread, and the disbeleif in what I saw. I started getting extremely paranoid. I would only walk my dog on the sidewalks on the left side of the road so I could always see the closest traffic to me. I wouldn\u2019t have headphones in so I could hear things coming for me. \n\nI saw someone that looked like someone that I didn\u2019t get along with in high school and went to a different store, scared of what they might do to me (they wouldn\u2019t have done anything it wasn\u2019t serious. Like so unserious I\u2019m sure he would have given me a hug and asked how I am lol)\n\nI stopped going outside because I was scared to die. \n\nI started drinking a lot, I had been sober for a few months before all of this. Went back to drinking but way worse and started blacking out every day/night to keep the images out of my head. That went on for about a month straight. Blacking out every day. \n\nI\u2019m trying to pull myself out of this. I\u2019m going on a trip to get into the hot weather and near some friends I haven\u2019t seen in a couple years. I\u2019m around loved ones that I\u2019ve talked to about it with (without going into detail). I have an appointment with my therapist but I don\u2019t find therapy to be super effective for me. I have gone through at least 25 therapists over the past few years trying to find a good fit.  Never have found anyone to be helpful. But this is a bit different and I\u2019m hoping for help.\n\nI\u2019m doing what I know is the best for me. I don\u2019t feel suicidal. Shit I\u2019m terrified of it. But this whole thing has really fucked me up bad. I\u2019m months behind on work. I\u2019m having constant nightmares. And I feel like Ive done something horrible. \n\nI\u2019m just a mess",

    "selftext": "This is much worse than the title suggests if you can believe it.. I lost both my job and girlfriend last night over a stupid, impulsive decision. I tried apologizing because I genuinely feel horrible, but she blocked me from all her social media and isn't responding to my texts.\n\nSome time ago I brought a girl up to see the skyline from the condo building I was just forced to resign from. The model units are fully furnished and I've spent the night there on a few occasions. We had sex in one of them and at my place every time after that. I convinced her to visit me at work because I was there till late and everything went according to plan, until it didn't.. I heard the door open and two people walk in so I grabbed all her stuff and threw in the closet. She asked if we weren't supposed to be there and I shook my head no. I then grabbed my t-shirt and underwear and hid in the closet with her.\n\nThe realtor that works exclusively with the building sometimes brings her parents to help redecorate. That's who walked in on us. Because I was focused on hiding my naked girlfriend I forgot to grab the rest of my clothes when we hid in the closet. The father noticed the door to the room we were in was shut so he opened it and saw the unmade bed. He called his daughter (realtor) and put her on speaker phone then went \"you're not going to believe this, someone was using the bed in here!\" And she went \"OMG ARE YOU EFFIN SERIOUS?!\". He asked one of them to come get her and I thought that was my opening to get out of there. But I saw he was still there so I warned girlfriend to stay put. She was thankfully clothed at this point, but visibly shaken. I could hear her shallow breaths and panting like she was about to have a panic attack. The mom returns with her realtor daughter and shows her what they found.\n\n\"Look someone left their clothes here and there's a phone on the table\" the dad said. \"Take a picture... Wait, is someone still in here?\" She walked over to the closet and tried to pull the door open so I came out before she had a chance to. At this point I'm in my underwear because I didn't have all of my clothes with me. She went \"JESUS WTF?\" and I told her I was really sorry, but I was just so tired I wanted to take a nap. She then saw what I was wearing and went \"Jesus ___!\" - I asked if they could leave the room so I could change and she agreed. I got dressed and told the girlfriend to wait until I tell her it's okay to leave. She gave me the death stare and said nothing.\n\nThey had left the floor when I exited the unit and so I went back to get her. I then snuck her down to the basement so she could leave through a backdoor. She seemed incredibly upset so I asked if she was okay. She went \"you just risked my life in there\" and then stayed silent the rest of the ride. She's a friendly, warm person by nature so it was unsettling seeing her this angry. I could feel her animosity.\n\nRealizing there was no coming back from this I emailed my boss my resignation letter and instinctively blocked all my work contacts. Girlfriend hates me now and probably ignored my apology text.\n\ntl;dr Almost got caught in bed with a girl by my coworker and her parents. Had to quit, girlfriend dumped me.",

    "selftext": "Trigger Warning: Self Harm\n\nI am struggling today. I was driving home from work, after being completely dressed down- feeling demoralized, worthless and stupid. Reminding myself that I can\u2019t cry now. I have to pick up my kid in a half an hour and I don\u2019t want him to know how bad I feel. But this writhing cannon ball of pain, lodged in my throat was burning. The thought of cutting flashed to the forefront. I visualized myself in the bathtub, my inner thigh- calculated how many hours till after bedtime. I felt deeply relieved to imagine it. Then I thought how sick I was for seeing that as a solution and how there are stable grown fucking adults out there, living life that would never and have never had that train of thought. Then I feel more pathetic and unworthy. If I didn\u2019t have my kid to love and care for, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be here. I don\u2019t feel like I belong, I feel so out of place and out of step with the world. Im alone and so tired. \n\nI need a hug, badly, I think. My family was never very affectionate, I have always indirectly tried to fill that cup of closeness. My mom hated men but but would still tell me to stay pretty so they\u2019ll want you, be quiet and obedient like a good Catholic girl should. That\u2019s the way. She\u2019d confide in and talk to me like an adult until what was left of my child-self was smothered out. My grandmother told me to never ever love a man more than he loves you, because he will use that and break you. She hated men as much as my mother. My older sister taught me how to despise and abuse my body with pills, supplements and over-exercising to keep it in shape- because what\u2019s more important than that as a female? So, ladies- where has all of that sage advice gotten me? I\u2019m scared to fall fully in love. I obsess over food, restrict and binge- then restrict again. I weigh myself everyday, I panic if my jeans are feeling tight. I can\u2019t stand to look at myself in the mirror. I pick men who are unavailable in one way or another. I want the love and affection, safety and security but I don\u2019t know how to accept it.\n\nThe self harm part I can\u2019t attribute to anyone but myself- the stash of razor blades, rubbing alcohol, bandaids and scar cream- it\u2019s all me. I picked that up somewhere along the way. Probably some innocuous injury that captivated my attention just long enough, distracting me from the outside, pulling me back into my body- it somehow felt right, a relief. I worry about passing this madness down, I worry about being found out. I go to therapy and do all the things people with CPTSD need to do. But this self-hating angry, sad thing lives inside me, consuming my insides, kills any confidence. It yearns for all of these things that are just so far out of my reach. I\u2019ve been in love, I think and accepted being hurt, apologetically or unapologetically. Sex fixes it- for a little while. Filling that void- feeding that need for affection or offering some level of fulfillment. Sometimes I\u2019m there, sometimes I\u2019m disassociating completely.\n\nI have often wondered what true and regular intimacy feels like- making love, being held every night, feeling safe, being touched and kissed gently, with care and intent. I wish I knew how to find that. I wish I could be sure I would even know how to accept it. I must come off so cold to people, if they only really knew me- on the inside. They might come to know that I feel every word, I feel every look, I feel every touch- like lava. But I don\u2019t know how to convey that. I don\u2019t know how to find that middle ground, that softness while still being strong. I wish I knew that I had a person out there, just waiting for me to figure this puzzle out. Or maybe they are just as fucked as I am and we are both walking along this road completely lost and totally unaware. I\u2019m so damn tired. Guess it\u2019s time for that bath and then maybe some semblance of sleep before starting the show all over again tomorrow. \n",

    "selftext": "TW: Self Harm Mentions and ED Mentions\n\nI (17F) am 5'1 and 220 lbs. I am fat. \n\nI live with my mom, aunt, uncle, and cousin (26F). My cousin recently received a gastric bypass surgery and has lost over 100 lbs. She used to be close to 400 lbs and is 5'9. She is now 260. Only 40 pounds heavier than me. I have to face her everyday and I can't help but compare my body to hers.\n\nMy mom is a single mother and wouldn't be able to afford the surgery for me; we can't even afford a monthly gym membership. I'm scared for how expensive dieting will be. She wants to start eating healthier with me and working out together, which I want and I desire for myself, but I'm scared.\n\nI have been disappointed by my efforts for weight loss multiple times; each of which failing and making me more depressed than before. I have chronic depression, a chemical imbalance, which only worsens with the fact that I'm an overweight fuck. I hate my body. I've cut myself, I've deprived myself of food, I've smoked. I tell myself there is no hope, so why bother to take care of myself.\n\nI want to be skinny, but I'm also honest with myself, and I'm not sure I'm willing to do what it takes. Being fat is a choice, and unfortunately it feels like my only one. I'm lazy, depressed, and have no hope. I go to a school where for one fat person, there are fifty skinny ones. I think about how much work it takes to wake up and cry thinking about how hard it will be for me to make healthy choices. I can't even bring myself to brush my teeth for fucks sake. It's a miracle I go to school. \n\nBeing fat is so dehumanizing, you know that everyone notices your weight. When you walk in the school halls, you're uncomfortably aware of your size and how you look walking. When you sit and feel your shirt tighten around your back, you want to rip it off. When you see your stretch marks in the mirror, you begin to notice what is happening to your body. When you sit to eat, you start to believe that every whisper is about you. When you look down and see your reflection in your phone, you can only notice your double chin and fear if others did too. It feels as though every thing you do is big when you're fat.\n\nI've been called fat and bullied my entire life. Just today someone made a comment about my diet and my weight. People who don't know you always feel so confident in themselves to say something about your issue. If you haven't been fat, or have never been fat, I don't want your opinion. I know these things about myself. I don't want to be the fat one. It's so cruel and disgusting. You'd think with all of this I'd have the urge to do something about myself, but the only urges I have are to lay in bed and rot. I'm hopeless. I wouldn't wish fatness on my worst enemy.\n\nBeing fat is humiliating.\n\n\n\n",

But I was young and idealistic and wanted to help people and change the world so I tried to make it work, even if I didn\u2019t have wealthy parents to bankroll what amounted to a less-than-minimum wage job like some of my peers. \n\nThe DC metro area is notorious for having an extremely high cost of living. To save as much as possible, I lived in an unfinished basement that didn\u2019t legally qualify as a bedroom in a suburban house shared by people I found on Craigslist. Even still, my rent was $950, which at the ridiculous $30k I was on, was almost half my take home pay. I\u2019d skip breakfast every day and meal prep as cheaply as possible for my lunches dinners - we\u2019re talking rice, bulk chicken breast or whatever protein was on sale, and cheap frozen vegetables 95% of the time. I had student loans and credit card debt to pay as well \u2014 I was having to budget like crazy, and not in a fun way. I couldn\u2019t afford to go to the bars or sporting events with my college friends or wealthier colleagues on the Hill, and I even sold plasma a few times when it got really tight. \n\nPoint is, I was struggling. Lucky to have a job and a roof over my head, but struggling.  \n\nI\u2019ll get to the point. In the Capitol office buildings there are cafeterias on the basement levels. They\u2019re there for staffers and the public alike. There was one way in, you\u2019d get your food from the salad bar or whatever counter, you\u2019d go through the line of cash registers, and then walk straight through that area to the seating area, and through that area was the \u201cexit\u201d. It was kind of a one way deal - move you from cafeteria through to seating and then back out. Most of the public - tourists, constituents, lobbyist or groups there for meetings - went through and sat. \n\nUnless you were a staffer taking your lunch back to the office to have a working lunch. Many staffers would pay at the register and instead of walking through the seating area, they\u2019d turn around and go back through the line to get back to the elevators that took you back up to the offices because it was a shorter walk. \n\nOne day I was down there taking a meeting with folks (conference rooms were booked or something) when I was watching the ritual occur and it occurred to me\u2026 no one was at the entrance checking staffers who walked back out the entrance with their lunch. You could probably just order and pick up your food, loiter/mill around for a minute, and walk right back out the way you came in, and no one would be any the wiser. \n\nThus began the 3 year long spell of me stealing lunch from the Capitol cafeteria. It was brilliant. I never ate breakfast and never paid for lunch, so I basically cut my grocery bill in half, and got to eat better too!\n\nI know it was technically wrong. I justified it to myself in a couple ways. One, I\u2019m literally on poverty wages. And two, this isn\u2019t some small mom and pop shop I\u2019m hurting - it\u2019s some big company with a government contract. I bet they didn\u2019t even notice. \n\nI think some of the workers picked up on it eventually. There was one guy who I have to think figured me out, but he only worked Tuesdays and Fridays. He glared at me a lot. I would\u2019ve avoided him but he was at the station that made the buffalo chicken wraps I was so fond of. The rest of them that I think noticed? They didn\u2019t care at all. \n\nThis was all 10+ years ago. I\u2019m doing much better now and I am now in a position to give back a lot to people in need - I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s only over the guilt of stealing for for 3 years but I won\u2019t lie - it\u2019s certainly a motivating factor when I don\u2019t feel like going to volunteer some days \ud83d\ude02",

    "selftext": "My boyfriend (M22) wanted to eat me out but his parents were home. I (F24) said we shouldn't but he was so turned on and I was turned on I said ok. We went into one of the upstairs bathrooms and he went to town on me. If I didn't have a chance to use wet wipes to clean up everything nicely before he does, I usually encourage him to eat me out with me on my back. Today, he insisted on me being on my belly over the sink because he's a butt guy. I was mortified that afterwards, when we went back to his room, he had a smear of my poo on his nose. \n\nI eat a very clean diet except today, even though I had used a wet wipe earlier, things weren't clean as a whistle in the butt dimension. He didn't address it and kept cool, said it was so hot (I gave him bj and swallowed)\n\nHe said after \"We should do it earlier in the day\" and I felt so embarrassed by that idk why but I think it's because I'm not normally that gross in the butt. 6 years of dating and this has never ever happened. He didn't even clean the smear of poo off his nose, I licked my finger to run it off and then I realized it wasn't coming off and it was brown. I went and got a tissue (no wet wipes) and licked the paper to then apply it to his skin to clean it off his nose. \n\nI'm back at my apartment (I'm too stressed to go to the bathroom and see what he had to deal with and btw my undies are spotless) and I texted him so I could be transparent about it and prevent it from happening again and he only said he needed to buy wet wipes I'm not allergic to. It's probably fine but I want to die inside. I hope he gets more chatty again. He seemed very dead pan and sweet after the whole situation. \n\nTLDR: My boyfriend ate me out and when he was done he had poo on his nose - never been more mortified \n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone for your kind words! I feel better but still dying inside LOL",

I'm too scared to say what he did specifically because the last time I tried talking about it on here people accused me of lying. \n\nBut it happened and my aunt made a giant Facebook post about it. My mom and aunt haven't been talking for a year because my mom basically chose to be with him despite knowing my family hated him\n\nThe Facebook post went sort of viral in our community. There are also news articles about it. People have been sending him death threats. Everyone knows what he did. People know my mom stayed with him. A lot of people we know are messaging her and calling her a bad mom because she stayed with him knowing me and my brothers who are babies also live with him\n\nMy mom and I had a big fight about it. She thinks my aunt was exaggerating. She was not. I got upset and told her that we have every right to be upset. What he did was wrong and disgusting. She said that if I thought that way I could leave and go live with my aunt. \n\nThat hurt a lot. But wasn't all that shocked as she dismisses my feelings a lot whether she'll admit it or not.\n\nI started packing and she backpedaled and told me she didn't mean it. We were both crying.

He was a bad partner and father. \n\nI told her some other things and insulted her and I feel like crap about it. Her boyfriend acted like he didn't understand what was happening. I'm at my aunts and I miss my mom a lot. I don't plan to go back until Saturday evening cause that's when her boyfriend goes to work. \n\nI'm so angry at her but so sad for her because she deserves better. I keep thinking about how shitty life turned out to be when she met her boyfriend and I wish so badly that she had never met him. \n\n",

It started off pretty innocuous- kids playing doctor and what not. But around age 10 I told him to stop. He didn't stop. This culminated in me being 14, screaming my head off as he held me down to the floor. Eventually he stopped when someone came inside. \n\nA short while later (I can't remember how long) I woke up to him being in bed with an 8 year old girl who was staying with us. \n\nAs soon as I got to school that day I went to the school counselor. Who obviously called the police. He ended up spending about 4 years in Juvie. \n\nThat very same day, my parents called me into their bedroom. First thing my mom said was 'I knew something was going on, but I didn't think it was this bad'. And then my dad told me 'you should have come to us. We would have fixed it. You should never go to the police'. If you had known something was going on, why didn't you fix it then?!?!\n\nThat was the last we spoke of it. That was 19 years ago. After he got out of juvie, I was expected to have a normal relationship with him. Treat him like a brother. My mom even had me have him as a roommate when I was escaping a DV situation. \n\nHis life is now in shambles, well over a decade later. And it always feels like people blame me for ruining any opportunity he had at life. \n\nAnd, here I am, just expected to play nice and forget any of this has every happened. My parents never sent me to therapy. Never even really talked about it with me besides reminding me I shouldn't go to the police. I've since found my own therapy, and am working through everything. But it's rough. I still have issues being intimate with my husband. I didn't used to. That started when my brother got out of juvie (husband and I have been together since we were 15) . \n\nI'm 33 now and there are still times this absolutely monopolizes my life. Tonight included. \n\nThanks for listening I guess. I never feel safe talking about this. So I appreciate you listening. ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone. Tonight my wife (33f) told me (31m) that she no longer is in love with me and hasn\u2019t been for quite some time due to her thinking she is a lesbian. She said she has felt like this for quite some time but has been pushing it down and ignoring it for the sake of our marriage and our family. She was sobbing and kept saying sorry and asking me if I hate her. Of course I was crying to and reassured her I don\u2019t hate her and that it\u2019s ok. But I\u2019m having a hard time accepting it and kept asking her if she\u2019s sure or is it just built up resentment that is causing her to think she feels that way. She says she is pretty sure. I told her I will be a better husband and take her on more dates and put our relationship first and we can fix this and she kept telling me there\u2019s nothing to fix, she\u2019s felt like this for a long time but that she couldn\u2019t pin point what it is. \n\nShe recently became friends with a lesbians co worker who is married to another woman. I think they have gotten close over the last month and she went over to their house last weekend to hangout. It was after that that I noticed she was acting a bit different and all week I kept asking her what\u2019s going on. Tonight she finally told me that after seeing her lesbian friends relationship with her wife she realized that she longed for something similar and that she was not getting it from me and that she thinks she had been into woman for a long time she just didn\u2019t really give any attention to it.\n\nWe have 4 children. 7, 9, 12 and 15. I am step dad to the two older kids. My initial reaction was confusion, and then sadness and heartbreak after realizing that my family is never going to be whole again. \n\nIt does not help that our relationship has not been the best, not terrible but not amazing for the last couple years. We\u2019ve been so busy with work and just day to day things that we never really put much focus on our marriage and any free time would go to the kids. \n\nI feel so sad bevause I know my 2 younger daughters will not take this well. We almost split up about 1.5-2 years ago and my 9 year old then (7ish) had a complete melt down when we broke the news. We decided to make it work and our relationship has improved so much after that and the fighting has stopped but overtime the passion died and although we continue not to fight like we used to we still bicker and we lack passion in our relationship. \n\nI always attributed this to just busy life and stress and figured over time it would get better. We just recently moved last month into a bigger home and a different town and we have much more space for our big family. The move was chaotic and stressful but we\u2019re past the worst of it and I really was looking forward to this warm weather and our new chapter.\n\nI love my wife with all my heart. I think I got complacent as a husband and stopped trying like I used to and I keep blaming myself for this and wonder what I could have done to prevent this if I could. She keeps telling me it\u2019s not my fault and that she\u2019s really sorry. I keep trying to find ways to fix it. I\u2019m having a hard time accepting it and I\u2019m just really really confused, surprised and heart broken. I also feel bad that she has been living with this and trying to make it work for the kids\u2026.\n\nShe already talked to her mom and sister about it so i know that she is planning on splitting up. She said we don\u2019t have to rush it but we should start planning soon. She wants to tell the kids within the next month or two. I hate to put that on them because we just moved and after the summer they will be moving to their new school. \n\nagghhhh this is such a messy feeling. I really\nThought we would stick it out to the end. I had no doubt she was the one I was spending my life with and just a few weeks ago she reassured me that I was the one she was going to spend her life with as well. \n\nI keep hoping she is going to change her mind but I just don\u2019t really see it happening.",

I cradled him in my arms and shaking I brought him inside the building to the man that kept guard there and told him what happened. \n\nWhat pissed me of is that he knew who the owner was, and he later revealed to me that he had warned her to protect her balcony because this might happen. \n\nWhen the owner came down, she was expecting to see a dead cat but with relief she saw her cat was alive and gave him back to her. At this moment I was crying with a running nose and how I could I told her she needs to secure her balcony because this happens. \n\nShe said everything was protected but clearly it wasn\u2019t because this happened. She lives in the 7th floor. The cat was so lucky to survive. He was walking but clearly in pain, I was so surprised but so thankful. \n\nI hated that my boss saw me in that state but whatever, my priority then was that cat. Later my boss told me she was a friend of his and then without caring he was my boss I told him she need to protect her place if she owns a cat. \n\nBefore leaving I insisted to the frontman to remind that woman to secure the balcony, because next time could be fatal. \n\nGosh, why people do this?

I know how deep, how full, how alive this love was.\nAnd I know that kind of love demands courage.\n\nBut what breaks me is knowing you felt it too.\nYou felt it\u2014and still stepped back.\nStill disappeared into your fear.\n\nI saw the man you could become.\n\nThe one who might look back one day, years from now,\nand finally understand what he lost.\nThe kind of man who will close his eyes and remember how I looked at him\u2014\nlike he was already whole, even when he didn\u2019t believe it himself.\n\nI hope that man doesn\u2019t come too late.\nBut if he does, I hope he remembers that I stayed.\n\nThat I waited.\n\nThat I loved without walls.\n\nAnd when I left, it wasn\u2019t to hurt him.\nIt was because I had nothing left in me to give.\n\nThis love?\nIt opened something sacred in me.\nBut it also left me standing alone in a place I should never have had to survive by myself.\n\nI am not a backup plan.\nI am not an echo of something you once had.\nI am a whole woman.\nAnd if you couldn\u2019t choose me when I was right in front of you\u2014\nyou don\u2019t get to come back for me once I\u2019ve healed.\n\nAnd yes\u2014today, if you came to me, I\u2019d still open my arms.\nStill fall into your chest. Still want you to stay.\n\nBut soon\u2026 I\u2019ll be too far gone.\nAnd once I\u2019ve found peace,\nonce I\u2019ve stitched myself back together without you\u2014\nI won\u2019t ever let you touch my heart again.\n\nAnd if that day comes\u2014\nif you feel the echo of me in some quiet room,\nif something aches and you remember my love\u2014\nI hope you say the truth:\n\n\nShe knew I was afraid.\n\nShe saw me clearly.\n\nAnd she loved me anyway.",

    "selftext": "\\*tagged NSFW because of my industry.  \n  \nI used to think aging in this industry was a countdown clock. People love to push the idea that if you\u2019re not 21 forever, you\u2019re somehow past your prime..  And we\u2019ve all seen the comments.. I\u2019ve heard the assumptions and grew up with my own tbh. But as I\u2019ve gotten older in this industry, I\u2019ve learned to trust my own voice, and honestly? I wouldn\u2019t trade that for anything. \n\nWhen I was younger, I second-guessed everything. I stressed over posting at the perfect time, worried about keeping up with trends, I cared more about who I could collab with over my personal brand. I dreaded the day I received a comment at 22 saying I was \u201cold\u201d and then I turned 23, 24..eventually 30..36 and counting..I\u2019m still here.\n\nSo I can finally get this off my chest: experience is hot. If you\u2019ve ever looked at PH's Year in Review, you know \u201cMYLF\u201d is always one of the most searched terms. Last year, it was literally the second most popular category worldwide. \u201cMature\u201d is right up there too. And the biggest chunk of viewers? They\u2019re not 18-year-olds. Most adult site traffic comes from people 30+, with a huge percentage in the 35-44 range. There\u2019s a massive audience for people who actuallly know what they\u2019re doing.  \n\nI see younger creators burning themselves out trying to keep up with every trend, and I get it. I used to do the same. But the creators I know in their 30s (40s and 50s) are out here making more money, setting real boundaries, and actually having a life. Things really change when you stop looking at the comments. Positive or negative.\n\nSo yeah, getting older in this space comes with challenges, but I wouldn\u2019t go back. Longevity isn\u2019t about being the youngest or the trendiest.. it\u2019s about knowing how to work the system instead of letting it work you. If you\u2019re 30+ and still in the game, you\u2019re not past your prime. You\u2019re just getting started.",

    "selftext": "sigh. its the classic story of a boy falling for a girl he wasn't supposed to. im 17M and she's 17F. we met in 9th grade 4 years ago. we were both new admissions to the school and we were both new to this city too. so naturally conversation striked up and back then I was still recovering from the lockdown trauma and shit so I was a bit of a prick, not just to her but to everyone. but she still saw that I was a good guy at heart and she still wanted to be friends with me. slowly but surely I started getting normal and we became ever close. she was genuinely the best human being I had ever met and that feeling grew as I got to know her more and more. in 10th summer vacas we both organised this gig in a bar and we practised at the drummers house every day for 8 hours for 2 weeks. that was when we actually became very very close and we 'officially' became best friends. we both love big bang theory so we wrote up a best friend contract and it had a clause added just for fun: 'neither party shall, till the last date of validity of this contract, acquire any romantic feelings for the other'. I genuinely considered her as my sister and we both such great time together. im telling every guy out there, the best thing that will ever happen to you is your girl best friend. we used to talk everyday, ask each other about how our days went, give each other therapy whenever something or the other happened, she taught me skincare and how to talk to girls. im basically a girlie only now (no I'm not bi or wanting to transition, it's like how marshall became a sis with lily in himum iykwim)\n\nanyways, many people, even in our closest friend circles thought that eventually we would get feelings and start dating. but we didn't. we often had late night conversation and we would sometimes talk about how amazing it is to have such a deep, purely platonic relationship with someone from the other gender. enough preface, I'll get to the imp stuff now \n\nup until the begining of 2025, everything was normal. we had this event in our school and we had to sit in the backstage for like 4 hours doing nothing (she was not in the event, it was me and some other friends). i start yapping with one of my friends who just got back with his ex. he said how they'll try to do long distance during college because he couldn't see him marrying anyone else but his gf. i said that's so sweet, saying that I don't think ever liked a girl enough to say I wanna marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. but then, in the corner of my brain, a bunch of latent neurons fired and a name entered my head. it was my best friend's. and I physically shook when i realised what happened. i just imagined myself marrying my best friend. THE SAME GIRL I LOVED LIKE MY OWN SISTER AND I THIUGHT OF MARRYING HER. i put myself into COMPLETE DENIAL MODE. it was nearing feb so I just told myself it's just because I'm desperate for love for valentine's day. January turned to february which turned to march and now it's April. my feelings haven't died down and I'm genuinely on the brink of my mental strength. she and I have regular calls atleast 2-3 times a week and its genuinely such a stress reliever. a few days back we were on a call and her younger brother (he's 2) came into her room to play with her. she started a video called and I watched her and her brother play with hotwheels. her brother knows me too so he kept showing his cars to me too and I baby talked to him a bit too. it was genuinely the best part of this very stressful week. towards the end of our 2 hour call, she put her brother to sleep and she started singing a lullaby to him. we were still on our video call. listening to her sing, I felt an emotion I don't think I'd ever felt before. she's a very bad singer but this time, her lullaby was such a melody, and I felt such a peace. I looked at her smiling, and when she saw me, she smiled back with a sparkle in her eyes. (god help me I love her eyes.) and in that moment, I thought to myself, isn't this what love is supposed to feel like? my parents came back a few mins later so we wished goodnightt and cut the call. \n\ni immidiately hopped on another call to talk to my other girl best friend about this. she's going through something similar and we just ranted to each other for like a good 3 hours. i asked if I should tell her, if i should just get it out there that I'm in love with her. my friends response was, you can but are you willing to live with the consequences? best case she says yes which has a probability of 0.0001 and worst case, it becomes awkward for a month but then it's back to semi normal. i told her, well that doesn't sound too bad. and then she said \"but after that month, you won't have you regular calls, you won't be able to walk with her in school like you do, you won't be able to be in the same friend groups, you might still be friends but it'll never be the same.\"\n\ni can handle her saying no, I can live with the fact I might never have her, but I cannot live in a reality where she and I aren't best friends. i can live in a world where I can't hold her, snuggle with her, tell her I love her or ever get to see the eyes of love from her. but I can't live in a world where we don't talk, where we aren't as close as we are now, where we aren't best friends. this girl is the person who knows me better than anyone else on this planet, perhaps ever better than I know myself. i genuinely can't live without her. but at the same time, the fact that I love her is eating me up whole.\n\ni don't really expect someone to read this whole and give me tips, but if someone does, pls tell me what to do. im all out of ideas.\n\n",

    "selftext": "\n\nOk, hear me out. I know it was only two weeks, but I\u2019ve never felt a spark like this with anyone else. This guy matched me in ways no one ever has\u2014our humor, music, views, interests, everything. I met him through a mutual friend, and at first, it felt perfect. The only issue was how intense he came in. I usually take my time, but since our friend vouched for him, I let myself ignore my instinct.\n\nHe\u2019d just come out of a 3-year relationship that ended six months ago\u2014his ex broke up with him over text. I thought, okay, he might still be healing, but let me give it a shot. We clicked. We talked. He flirted. We finally met in person, and the first date was amazing\u2014it felt like we\u2019d known each other forever.\n\nBut\u2026 he talked about himself nonstop. My friend said he was probably just nervous, and before meeting he did ask questions about me. But after that, everything was about him. A few days later, we spent the whole day together and ended up sleeping together. That\u2019s when things shifted.\n\nThe next morning, I kissed him, and he just looked at me blankly. I pulled away, and he got dressed and left without saying anything\u2014just kissed me on his way out. After that, his texts became detached. I didn\u2019t react at first, but the next day I ignored his texts, and he responded saying he was having financial issues. I said I understood, but asked him to communicate better.\n\nWe mainly texted because he lived an hour away and sometimes worked for weeks straight. I was okay with that. But his texts were still mostly about him\u2014his job, his hobbies, his day, his struggles. I knew everything about him. He barely asked about me, aside from a \u201chow are you?\u201d here and there.\n\nThen I left for an academic conference. We were still texting until one day I asked why he didn\u2019t seem curious about me. He apologized and said he was stressed and his past relationship was still affecting him. I said I understood, but I needed to know what his intentions were. He said he wasn\u2019t ready for an emotional connection but \u201cif we fall in love, I\u2019d be okay with that.\u201d I asked why he started this if he wasn\u2019t ready, and he said \u201cI guess I just don\u2019t want to rush.\u201d\n\nFine. But the next day he was even more distant. I was stressed out, away from home, and my father was fatally ill overseas. I asked him about our plans for a date the next day, and he responded vaguely, saying we\u2019d go on a walk but \u201che wouldn\u2019t stay over.\u201d We had been planning to hang out, play games, and chill, but now he was putting up emotional (and physical) boundaries. I asked him for a time\u2014he ignored me. Then he ignored my messages altogether but still sent me messages about his day on IG like nothing was happening.\n\nThat night I was overwhelmed. I sent him a message, saying I was trying to get to know him, support him, and show up, even with my own stresses. And that I didn\u2019t deserve to pay the price for what his ex did to him. The next day he ended things. Just like that. Coldly. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should pursue a relationship. You deserve someone who can support you.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t even what I was asking for. I was just asking for basic connection and respect.\n\nI tried to be understanding, but he kept ignoring me. Eventually, I apologized for getting overwhelmed. He said we should move on. I said okay, but if he ever wanted to stay friends, I\u2019d be open to it. He ignored that, too.\n\nTwo weeks later, I returned a book he lent me through our mutual friend and messaged him just wishing him well.\n\nHe ignored that too.\n\nBut he still follows me on Instagram. He\u2019s always one of the first to watch my stories. And it bothers me so much. I want to block him, but I\u2019m so hung up. Why did something so short affect me this deeply?\n\n",

    "selftext": "For context I\u2019m M27 married to F22. We had an arranged marriage and are in a long distance relationship . The first 6 months we talked on the phone for hours and I fell in love with her . After that overtime things got stranger . I use to send her memes and reels on insta and we both come from a conservative culture but we had some frank discussions. Fast forward she started college ( she was 19 and I was 24) . Her behaviour started to change she would avoid replying to my texts for days and make up excuses not to call. She once said that since we were only engaged she didn\u2019t really feel that comfortable to talk . I was bummed but said fine so we texted . She took offense to a meme that I sent and we didn\u2019t talk for a month . I found out through someone that she made plans with a mutual acquaintance of ours to go with him to a concert. This was shocking cause she said she was really conservative and didn\u2019t want to talk to me until marriage but was willing to go with him. Through her mom I requested that she call me and we talked for a bit but I didn\u2019t bring up that I knew about the concert . For the next 5 months I use to send her like 15 texts and would get 1 back days later almost no calls . I felt humiliated but didn\u2019t know what to do. One day I called her and said I want to end things cause I feel like somethings wrong and I deserve better . She cried and said she\u2019s just busy with her studies in college and that\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t called. It was honestly weird for me the reasons she was giving but in my heart I was afraid to end it. I brought up the concert and she said that it was never a serious plan just something that they said but weren\u2019t going to do. She knew I didn\u2019t like that guy but she defended him that he\u2019s not bad . She didn\u2019t give me any clear answers and said she wanted to talk to her parents . Her parents then called and said everything fine nothings the issue . After that her behavior improved and we saw each other about a month later for the first time since our engagement . It was fun and about 2 weeks later she left to go back home. For the first 2 weeks everything seemed fine but then she started doing the same thing , ignoring texts not calling not communicating . After a couple of months I confronted her on text and we had a fight I told my parents about it and it became a huge thing . Initially I wanted to end things but i thought I was overreacting so I backed down. My parents and her parents also thought we should still get married and her parents just said our daughters shy , she wants to get married there\u2019s no issue. We decided not to talk for a few months until our wedding. Fast forward we got married 4 months later . I was happy and hopeful everything will be fine. She was to stay at my house for 2 weeks then fly back home with her family . Her behaviour during those 2 weeks was all over the place . Sometimes she would be nice and affectionate sometimes she would insult my physical appearance to the point that it shattered all my confidence. She would be indifferent and aloof on her phone watching TikTok or texting. She just said that\u2019s how my personality is. She was on her phone constantly but she use to ignore my texts back when she was in another country on purpose , that realisation stung. When it was time for her to go we both were emotional and shed a few tears . After the wedding we talking only once on the phone. Now she had told me her friends use to tell her that she can do so much better and that hurt me  cause she didn\u2019t defend me infront of them . I use to text her if I should call or not but my mom said that I should just call. So I called her she didn\u2019t answer and would say can\u2019t talk, at that time she was with her friends so it almost felt like she was ashamed of me. I got mad initially but now I\u2019m indifferent. I did text her mom and said that if she cared she would take time out to call or text . Her parents and younger sibling call and text me a lot but she doesn\u2019t . Her parents mostly do it to make sure I don\u2019t end the relationship or something like that but I\u2019m tired of this . In a month we are going to be living together permanently and honestly that though gives me anxiety . She even asked me for a divorce literally a week after our marriage but I just thought it was her being immature and talked her out of it. Her future plans involve no kids ( I want kids, she was okay with kids before but now she isn\u2019t) , she just wants to get a job. I\u2019ve never said she shouldn\u2019t work , I\u2019ve always encouraged her but she seems to think that either family or a career . Her behavior and thought process is perplexing. I feel like she wants me to end the relationship so she isn\u2019t the villain infront of her parents . What should I do?",

Basically, I would feel gross dating a guy who only goes for younger women. I also said that I personally think anyone in an age gap relationship should ask themselves if their partner would still be with them if they were the same age, and if not, I think it's a bit of a red flag. The post got lots of engagement. Many women in the comments agreed with me, many guys did too. Some guys were angry at me, but one in particular began sending messages to me claiming to know me and how I'm a part of the reason that some men suffer bc of loneliness. I didn't take the threats seriously, until a guy showed up yelling horrible things at me at my door. He was much older too, maybe in his 50s, and kept banging on the door until I called the police and had to file a criminal report. I had lots of posts prior to this one that had lots of personal and identifying information, including pictures. I'm still a bit shaken and have taken down anything I've posted that gives away even a fraction of my identity.\n\nJust thought to share as this is the scariest thing that has happened to me in a very long time. I'm still nervous.\n\nEDIT: I didn't think this was going to get so many comments. Thanks everyone. Unfortunately, the reaction in my DMs is different with several angry men saying extremely vile and horrible things, and some of them asking if I would date a guy their age (which is mostly 45+) with really ugly pictures of their double chins and some other questionable body parts.

    "title": "My ex started seeing a guy not even a month ago and already has him staying at her house while my kids are there, and they're heard them loudly having sex. Today I found out the man she is seeing is my friend's boyfriend, who is also seeing 3 other women. Not sure how to handle this.",
    "selftext": "So, my ex met this guy, let's call him A, on March 14th. On March 17th, she called me while in bed next to him, asking me to watch our kids (7 and 11). Our 7-year-old's birthday was that following weekend, and my ex told me I couldn\u2019t come to the water park birthday party because it was going to be a \"girls' trip\" with her friend and her daughter. It turns out, the real reason was that she invited this new guy and his two daughters, since his youngest daughter's birthday was that following Wednesday. When my kids came home, they told me he had stayed at her house the entire week, even walking around in boxers and a tank top. My older daughter told me, \u201cMama closes the door for private time with her new boyfriend, and I can hear her breathing heavily and making weird noises\u201d (they share a wall).\n\nI confronted her, and she accused me of being jealous, telling me to get over myself, etc.\n\nSo today, I was venting to a friend about all of this when she suddenly said, \u201cWait, that sounds like my boyfriend.\u201d We started talking more, and it turns out it *is* her boyfriend. My ex thinks she and this guy are exclusive, but my friend found out today that he\u2019s not only seeing her, but also three other women. He\u2019s been lying to my ex, telling her he\u2019s with his friends gaming, but he\u2019s been staying at my old house or with one of the other women. She also told me this guy is going through a divorce that he keeps postponing, he doesn\u2019t have a job or a car, she bought him his phone, and he\u2019s living in an Airbnb that she doesn\u2019t know how he pays for (I\u2019m assuming his parents are helping).\n\nMy ex told our oldest daughter that she wants to marry this man already\u2014it hasn\u2019t even been a month. She also told her to treat him like a stepdad. My daughter said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know his name, I don\u2019t know what type of person he is, and I already have a dad,\u201d and also told me she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable at her mom\u2019s anymore. When my daughters came back here, they were both sobbing about the situation.\n\nNow I\u2019m not sure if I should tell my ex what I found out today. She\u2019s spiteful and will accuse me of being jealous. She will most likely become angry. My mom and sister both think I should stay out of it, especially because I don\u2019t have any legal right in our state to do anything about her having a guy stay over. My ex cheated on me and was also verbally and physically abusive, so my mom and sister think she needs to figure this out on her own, but I hate that my daughters are involved. My brother, on the other hand, thinks I should absolutely tell her so this man isn\u2019t around my kids, but I know it will backfire if I do.\n\nSo, humans of Reddit, how would you handle this if it were you? I\u2019ve been absolutely gutted by this for the past week, knowing there\u2019s been a random guy staying in my old house with my kids, and today really sent me over the edge. I don\u2019t want to be too reactionary; I want to make sure my girls feel comfortable, and I know legally there\u2019s nothing I can do. I really need some advice from people who aren\u2019t in my immediate orbit.",

    "title": "My husband went to rehab and I've been thriving. Is this salvageable?",
    "selftext": "I'm finally doing all the things I sat around waiting for him to do. I had a fire and burned an old broken dresser that was a menace to me getting around our bedroom along with a broken cat tree. I asked him over and over to please do something with them. I painted our bedroom, got my nails done, and re-did our 2 year old daughters bedroom. I've been doing crafts with my cricuit and made a onesie for my pregnant sister in law.\n\nI don't feel tied down to the stress of him not treating me well emotionally and the hurtful things he's done to me. He has absolutely worn me down over time. He's not abusive emotionally, just neglectful. Absolutely anything emotional I say to him is me \"doing too much\" and \"won't let anything go\" I've tried to explain that he feels that way because he won't let his ego down to just connect and understand. He says I make a big deal out of everything, but he makes no deal out of absolutely anything. You know what I mean?? His bar is set so low emotionally that when I ask for the bare minimum he won't connect with me.\n\nOne time I left and he didn't take it serious. He told his sister I took a 'dramatic' amount of stuff with me.\n\n\n____________\n\n\nExample of emotional neglect: \n\n3-4 years ago he yelled at me one night soon after my dad died. He had work early that morning, but I couldn't sleep so I woke him up and I wanted him to hold me or just tell me it was okay and he said \"I have to get up in just a few hours. you're not the one who has to get up early!\" He said it was just because he was tired, but like... I've never gotten over that. \n\nIt's hard to recover from all the nights I've cried by myself on the couch while he's slept peacefully.\n\nYeah hes apologized since then but I've never done crap like that to him. and that's just one example! The others are mostly just common relationship things that he doesn't want to hear. When he doesn't want to hear something I'm just the one \"making a problem\".\n\n\n____________\n\n\nIt's just driven me away from him and I told him for a long, long... long time that it was happening and he needed to start showing my emotions respect. I'm so sick of being made out to be \"dramatic\". I'm a grown woman and mother and I take care of our house and his laundry and maintain myself. He won't even keep his beard trimmed and he knows that's my biggest turn off. I'm emotionally mature and I know I am. I've extra realized this with him gone. He's ruined my self esteem and him being gone has brought out who he suppressed. I use to have no self respect and the more I grow into myself and gaining confidence the more I'm just not okay with who he is.\n\n\n__________\n\n\nRehab:\n\nSo now that he finally decided to stop drinking constantly and leaving beer cans in every trash can of our house and leaving them on the counters, smelling like beer and wanting to kiss (yuck), and growing a beer gut.... I'm expected to be there for him emotionally. Like he hasn't been for me. I feel so bitter. I've felt isolated emotionally and I ironically feel very emotionally fulfilled alone! (well, with my daughter too\ud83e\ude77) It would be nice to have someone to confide in and love on me though... everyone wants a cuddle and to just be listened to sometimes. A lot of the time he sits away from me and stuff and when I say something then he says \"well come closer\" but it feels like it's forced and not because he wants it, you know? I feel like I'm always putting out emotionally to feel closer and I'm exhausted. \n\nHe wouldn't even say good morning or kiss me and when I said something about it making me sad (because I love waking up and feeling butterflies for him) he said he's just not in the mood and now he feels like he has to or else I'll be upset. Like I just want to see some type of positive reaction to me being there... a kiss isn't that much to ask for. Several times he's woken me up by just pushing on me and a dry \"babe get up\" like???\n\nI want romance! passion! let's drop our daughter off with my mom and go on an adventure! hell, let's even take her! lol just show me a burning desire to be with me. I don't want to see couples being sweet and romantic and then think about what my relationship is like... I've always been a hopeless romantic. \n\nHe's severely hurt my confidence by looking at women in front of me and being obsessed with porn at one point. I don't like going out with him because it's a huge stresser that ruins my self esteem because I'm like \"she's attractive he's gonna look at her\" when I used to not be this way. I've always been a girls-girl. I hate judgmental women. and it's not against them at all. It's bitterness toward him completely. I'd never hate on another woman. It's made me compare myself and say \"is she more like the girls in the porn he watched? Is she more like the girls he's turned his head for in front of me?\"\n\n__________\n\n\nHe hasn't been using his time in rehab to better himself. They have a gym and he is always saying he's fat, but he won't go to it. He said he lays in bed and watches TV mostly and reads books. He's just trying to skate by and get home. Somethings not clicking and I just don't get it. If he gets home and things aren't any different then I think this temporary separation was that nail in the coffin. Because I've used my time wisely and I regained a lot of who I am! I don't deserve the stress he's put on me and damaged me with. Even if he stops drinking, it's not suddenly fixed. I'm afraid he just won't ever get it. Him not feeling sympathy for my emotional state and feelings makes me feel like I'm going to break my teeth clenching them. Like even when you don't completely understand someone you still have  compassion and at least try to. Try to freaking mediate in some kind of way. Not act like I'm nagging and act frustrated when I'm in the middle of calmly explaining. It's just gotten old. I feel refreshed and I can't go back into that rut. It wouldn't be fair!\n\nI've always felt like I need a strong leader. I desire to have that foundation of a man in a household. I know I don't need it and I've realized that being alone now, but I desperately want it. I want a man like my dad was. A strong Christian man that was confident and kind. When we got married I had no confidence, or direction with what I wanted in life. Now I do and it's painful that when I look at him... it's not fitting. I feel like I've allowed myself to be put down and I've lowered my self worth to think I'm happy when I'm only forcing it and pretending.\n\n_________\n\n\nWhat do I tell him when he comes back?\n\nAnyone else been through a temporary separation and relate?\n\nIs this just a case of \"needing to hear it from someone else\" to get it? or do I need to take the chance for him to be better when he gets back?\n\nI'm a Christian if that helps with advice. \u2665\ufe0f\n\n\nTL;DR- Husband went to rehab, I've felt like I can breathe from the emotional stone-walling, I'm afraid for him to come back because I can't bare that to continue, and I just need advice on what to tell him and where to go from here.",

Don't need advice I know what to do lol.\n\nIt's beyond frustrating these days to try and meet someone and date in your 30s. The complete lack of effort or genuine interest in having a normal conversation or going on a date is exhausting. These apps are a cess pool of time wasters who just want attention but won't offer a single thimble of reciprocation at all. All the conversations are vague, surface level, low-hanging fruit perspectives. There is no depth or stimulation - I am starting to understand why men are assholes on these apps. It's a joke.\n\nThe number of profiles that mention their hobbies as traveling, going out to expensive restaurants, or going to theme parks is astounding. Absolutely astounding this is how out of touch people are. Why is everybody's hobby something that costs hundreds if not thousands of dollars? And some even expect a man to foot the bill because that's what \"men do\"? In this economy? Please, stop. You all are so financially illiterate you don't even realize you can't afford these hobbies because you pay for them using a credit card.\n\nI'm going to just save myself the future frustration of trying to wade through this muk and delete these apps. I'd rather be single and lonely than start to feel jaded about an aspect of life that is supposed to bring happiness and joy. Lesson learned.",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nLet's go back about 2 years in time. I meet the lovliest, most bubbly woman on Tinder, we hit it off right away and I fall for her. Fast and hard.\n\nDuring our 2nd or 3rd time we meet she is sleeping at my place and she mentions that if she receives texts from a guy, it's from an old acquiantance who's been harrassing her, after they went on a date or two and had known each other from school. I find this weird, but she even shows me her texts how she's told him she's not interested in him, she has someone now etc, so I feel fine about this weird interaction. In fact I kind of appreciate the openness and honesty.\n\nLet's go forward half a year. At this point we're already living together. Somehow (unfortunately my memory doesn't serve me here, so I can't tell you how), I put two and two together and realised this story about the guy being an old random guy harrassing her just doesn't add up. I decide to confront the lady, she vehemently denies having lied. I go on to give her two options with A being: you admit you misrepresented that situation, apologize and tell me the truth or B: give me your phone, I go through it and if it turns out you did indeed misrepresent it, we're done.\n\nShe chose B and as you may suspect, this is where we broke up. For the first time at least.\n\nFor full context: What I found out was that she was very much emotionally involved with this guy, many times throughout her life and it was a back and forth kind of thing which never proceeded into a relationship. She did however as I mentioned earlier, tell the guy to fuck off, as soon as she met me. On the other hand she did meet me on Tinder the same day they had an argument.\n\nI'm gonna be honest, this did rub me the very wrong way for two reasons: 1) being lied to 2) since she jumped onto Tinder due to an argument with the other guy, I felt as though in the beginning I was sort of a rebound or plan B for her.\n\nAnyway, after a week or two of her begging for a second chance, despite some close people in my life being very strongly against it, I gave her a second chance.\n\nTo make the story shorter, two weeks later I catch her in an even more unnecessary lie (not directly related to the first), with even less sense, I break up with her on the spot, for good. This lie in and of itself would not have led to a breakup otherwise, it would've been a non-issue in a vacuum.\n\nOver a year has passed since. I have gone on dates with a metric tonne of women, have had 2 relationships (I ended both, due to not being happy) and it fucking pains me to say, I think I won't find anyone who I will be as happy with, as I was with her. I've had a lot of relationships, including some really long ones, but we were so similar and so compatible in every way, I after all this time, still sometimes miss; Both her and the feelings I felt during those months.\n\nAnd I'm just so baffled. She had to take the wrong turn at every point for it to go south.\n\nWhy mention the person? Why not delete the conversation? Why of all things hand me the phone (Im baffled by this up to this day)?\n\nDid I overreach in confronting her? Possibly. I'm not sure.\nDid I overreact by breaking up? Possibly. I'm not sure.\n\nBut how can one be so fucking stupid to create such a situation in the first place.\n\nI stand by my decisions I made that day. If I could go back, I would 99% make the same decisions. But I sometimes wonder if my ego and principles are less important than my happiness.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I won't get into the story of how we got together since that doesn't really matter but ever since we have been together I have not been able to stop thinking of other women sexually and it is absolutely killing me. I know I would never cheat and I have never acted upon any thoughts nor would I ever. It's just that ever since we got together I have awaken a terrible side of myself that I didn't even have before getting with her. I also have had a pretty bad porn addiction since high school which I have been very honest with her and have made quite some progress in quitting. I genuinely love her and I know no other woman has the same spot in my heart as her but the sexual thoughts are killing me and making me utterly guilty, making me feel like I have cheated. I do not know what to do, if I should even speak to her about it or not and I genuinely do not want to be like this. Apologies for my terrible English I am not a native speaker. Also I would accept any judgement and advice. ",

Ive always been the friend that checking on her making sure she was okay, caring about her but i don't get the same treatment in return . and STILL i genuinely never complained and i still cared about her. But her actions seems kinda harsh and not really concerning? like for example today she had the chance to come say happy eid to me and meet up but she chose to do a sleepover with her other friend:)) it really hurts so much i don't know what to do like should i open up to her or like is she toxic and should i just cut her off?. i should add that's the things she does always put me in doubt and makes me hurt and confused it's like our relationship is not  her  priority anymore and she doesn't care or put me on mind\nIt's eating me alive and im such an  overthinker and empathy so pls and kindly tell me what u think. what ur reaction would be plss",

    "selftext": "I need brutal honesty and advice. I\u2019m a compulsive liar, and no matter how hard I try, I keep fabricating insane lies about myself. It\u2019s gotten so bad that people genuinely believe a completely fake version of me, and I\u2019m terrified of being exposed.  \n\nSome examples of my lies:\n\nFake heritage: A lot of people genuinely think I\u2019m half Afro-Cuban (I even learned Cuban dances/recipes to sell it). In reality, I\u2019m 100% white European. I just think my real background is \"boring.\"  \n\nFake mental health severity: I do have autism and ADHD, but I exaggerate both of them\u2014acting more severely autistic and scatterbrained than I really am for sympathy/attention. It\u2019s kind of the opposite of masking I suppose.\n\nFake trauma: I tell people my dad abused me \"a lot\" as a kid. The truth is that he yelled often and called me worthless and stuff like that but he only hit me twice\u2014still bad, but not the extreme picture I paint with being hit daily and neglected.\n\nFake talents/intelligence: I claim to be a musical prodigy who \"turned down a record deal,\" and claim that if I would have accepted the record deal I would be famous by now but I can barely play an instrument. I also exaggerate my IQ when I\u2019m probably just average.  \n\nFake romantic and friendship history: I tell people girls constantly approach me and that I\u2019ve had exes. Truth? I\u2019ve never been approached, I\u2019m so childish and afraid of women that it probably wouldn\u2019t happen anyway, and I\u2019ve never even had a relationship, been on a date or even flirted before. I also claim that I have more friends than I really do.\n\nFake locations: I say I was born and raised in Louisiana (even though I\u2019ve never even been there) and pretend I\u2019ve traveled to countries I\u2019ve never visited.  \n\nWhy I do this:\nI think it\u2019s a mix of: Insecurity, Boredom, Attention-seeking, and maybe even impulse  control issues.\n\nBut now the lies are piling up, and I\u2019m stuck in a persona I can\u2019t maintain. The guilt is eating me alive and I honestly feel extremely worthless and manipulative.\n\nI know I sound like a mess, but I\u2019m tired of living like this. Any advice is appreciated\u2014even if it\u2019s harsh. I don\u2019t know if this is just me or something common with other autistic people but I think I might just be a manipulative individual.",

    "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place to talk about this. I\u2019m in my last year of college, and I was walking to my class this afternoon, stopping at the end of the sidewalk at an intersection, waiting for my turn to use the crosswalk.\n\nThe traffic lights turned yellow, and in that moment two things happened at once. The first: a boy, around my age, sped past my left side on his motorcycle, accelerating quickly to make the light before it turned yellow. The second: a pick-up truck on the opposite side of the intersection turned left into the lane in front of me, trying to make the turn before the light turned red. \n\nI realized at the same time the boy on the motorcycle realized that the truck was turning too close in front of him, and he jerked his motorcycle to his left to try and get out of the way. This was all happening just a few feet away from me. I kinda did that thing I usually do when you see close calls with car accidents, I held my breath a little bit and exhaled at the near miss. As I breathed out, it was like all of the noise happening at that moment just stopped. I swear it was dead silent, and the only sound I could process was the boy on his bike colliding directly into the side of the truck. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if time sped up or slowed down for me. I heard the sound first before my eyes could connect the two, and then pieces of motorcycle were falling everywhere. And I instinctively looked away before I could watch the boy\u2019s body impact the ground, as if I was turning away from a gruesome part of a horror movie. And then it all clicked\u2014 what I had actually just seen. I took a few steps towards the boy, and all I could do was say, \u201cOh my god,\u201d to myself. And I froze in place for a second because I realized I would have to look at the condition of his body in order to help, and I felt sick. \n\nThe people who had been waiting on the sidewalk with me, two of them rushed forward to help the boy, and others stayed back. After the second I had paused, I realized I didn\u2019t know much at administering aid, and I didn\u2019t want to crowd the boy and prevent others who knew what they were doing from helping. I fumbled at the side pocket of my backpack for my phone as the other witnesses who were helping the boy screamed to call 911. Two girls next to me were both already on the phone with 911 operators, so then I didn\u2019t want to hold up the phone lines with another call.\n\nI looked around, and every single car was stopped, leaving the entire intersection empty, except for the corner where the boy was, and a small crowd of people trying to help was forming. I walked past, yelling across the interesection at the other sidewalks where students were, asking if anyone knew how to help, they need to come over. Two girls ran over, immediately jumping in to check pulses, and do chest compressions. I made the mistake of looking at him. I can\u2019t get his face out of my mind. His eyes were wide open, his face in a permanent expression of just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, shock. But he wasn\u2019t moving or responsive at all, just glossed over eyes staring up at the sky. The girls were screaming that his pulse was dropping. I just waited out of the way with a few other witnesses who were there with me.\n\nMedics and the police came quickly, and the other witnesses and I were asked to wait to make witness statements later. All that they told us about him was that he was a student at our college. I found out later in the local news that the boy passed away after being transported to the hospital. I\u2019m so unsettled right now. All I can think about is that boy\u2019s face, and his last moments of consciousness were probably those of panic and terror, and how his family would have to get a phone call that their son died, and how he was just another kid like me with so much still to experience. I\u2019ve never been in a situation like this before, and I don\u2019t know how to move on.",

    "selftext": "I had more faith in her than in myself. I believed\u2014without a doubt\u2014that no matter how tough life got, we would fight through it together. I stood by her in her hardest moments, pushed her forward when she doubted herself, believed in her dreams even when she struggled to believe in them herself. I waited, prayed, and sacrificed, thinking that once she achieved what she worked so hard for, we would finally be happy together.\n\nBut life had other plans.\n\nEveryone calls Mumbai the city of dreams, but for me, it became the place where my dreams shattered. Success didn\u2019t just change her\u2014it erased the person I once knew. She moved to Mumbai, and suddenly, everything was different. The warmth in her voice faded. Her laughter became rare. Her words turned colder. She became robotic, distant\u2014almost like a stranger.\n\nThe same woman who once held my hand like I was her world now looks at me like I\u2019m a burden. She told me she needs someone \"at her level\"\u2014someone she doesn\u2019t have to teach how to survive in this city. Since when did love require qualifications? Since when did growing together become too much to ask?\n\nAnd then came the words that shattered me completely.\n\nShe questioned how she would \u201cmanage\u201d my family of 1 \u2014my mother, who needs special emotional care due to psychiatric issue. She called my mother an obstacle ( I agree this will create some problem in life) to her future goals, as if family was something to be weighed against ambition. I was speechless. The same person who once told me to prioritize health over money, to make memories because they last longer than success, now sees me and my family as a burden.\n\nPeople today have forgotten what truly matters. They chase careers, status, and power, leaving behind the ones who stood by them when they had nothing. And in that pursuit, they lose something far greater\u2014their own heart, their own humanity.\n\nBut no matter how much pain I carry, I can\u2019t forget who she was before all this. She was joyful, full of life, the woman who made me believe in love in its purest form. I still remember our first date\u2014holding her hand as we watched the sunset, believing that no matter what happened, we would always find our way back to each other.\n\nBut life has its own way of teaching lessons, and this one is the hardest to accept.\n\nI didn\u2019t just lose her. I lost my faith in love, in loyalty, in the idea that some bonds are unbreakable. I gave her my heart, my trust, my everything, only to be left shattered. Mumbai didn\u2019t just take her away\u2014it took away the warmth from her soul. And now, I stand here, broken into pieces, realizing that the person I loved the most, trusted the most, is no longer the same person I met on that first day.\n\nBut even after everything, she will always remain the most wonderful woman I have ever met. She changed me, taught me, helped me grow. She made me a better person. And even though things didn\u2019t end the way I hoped, I have nothing but respect for her.\n\nSome goodbyes don\u2019t come with closure. They come in silence, in distance, in the painful realization that the person you loved is now just a memory. It is difficult for me to accept this hard truth, but maybe some stories are never meant to have a happy ending",

But I see other families having some level of closeness and I get kinda jealous that that couldn't be me.",

Although i was never in ur life that much since i only saw you once or twice per year, it felt nice having someone that could look up to me in the family. We used to do so much together. \n\nSleepovers, at times we argued, playing games, watching tv etc. I even remembered when you called me a brother. That felt so special to me. I felt like some idol for you. You cared so much about me back then. You would call me a lot , text me random stuff and wanted to hang out a lot. \n\nYou even made me a card. This felt momentous to me. You always wondered why I didn\u2019t have my own friends but the reality is, I don\u2019t got any. I never fit in easily like you. All i had was a family like you that i barely got to see. Around dec 2019 you were a bit avoidant at times but you showed that you cared for me. but i feel Last time you cared was 2020 when you made a tiktok video for my birthday. But i\u2019ll admit i made a mistake. I never tried to keep in touch so much\n\nSometimes i would not respond to calls and i never texted at much. Last i saw you before the pandemic was new years 2020. Then i didn\u2019t see you for a whole 3 years at all until 2023\u2026 where you were completely different. I never decided to message or say anything except ur birthday. You started having a stronger bond with our other younger cousin and basically kinda forgot about me after a while. I wish i could go back in time and contact you more. \n\nWhen i saw you in 2023 again, I thought we would have a jolly good time. I expected at first you wouldn\u2019t say much then later we would. It never happened. You didn\u2019t bother talking to me, and i was too scared to say anything cuz you were acting way distant at times like adding a chair between us and avoiding sitting next to me. You didn\u2019t do it all the time but idk if you did this cuz your mom said not to do that. I couldn\u2019t tell if you hate me or not. You did invite me over once (not sure if it was forced) but you later said how you don\u2019t hang out with guys. Which was odd. \n\nAnyways i miss the old you, the times you weren\u2019t acting so distant, the times we would spam text emojis to each other and etc. Now it seems you have grown Ur a teenager now and you don\u2019t seem to care too much about family. You seem to have forgotten about me as days went by which i understand. You and my other cousin are important to me We all grew up together. \n\nI would text you guys now but idk if you\u2019ll would be bothered by it. I\u2019m gonna see you later this year for ur 15th birthday and i\u2019m scared if you\u2019ll be the same as before. I just wanna make the same good memories like back then\u2026 And it hurts more that my other cousin who barely knew me cuz she was mainly a baby when i met her, she barely even cares about my existence since i was barely there in her life",

He said \"you sound like a addict\" cause I basically am \ud83d\ude2d it's called Effexor. My daughter is 6 and my boyfriend of 11 years walked out of the house today while our daughter was at school, after a argument we had. He packed his PlayStation and a couple pairs of clothing.

He gets paid Friday. My daughter and I are fucked now for bills. My car payment is gonna be fucked and so are a couple other bills, plus groceries I was looking forward to. I also have a income but I don't get paid till next week and we just used all our savings for first and last months rent on a new place. Anyway I'm so upset. I called the police to find out where he was to make sure he was safe but also cause I miss him. He told the police he will come home when he calms down is his wording. They found him at his co workers house who gives him rides to work sometimes....why lock the bank account and screw me and your kid. I'm stressed. Probably gonna sell our Nintendo switch tomorrow just to make sure my car payment gets paid. I miss him but I also feel like a idiot for missing him.

    "selftext": "Life can sometimes feel like a chaotic journey, where we often wear a protective shield until we make choices that lead us down complex and challenging paths. Our response to life's trials is what truly defines our journey\u2014whether it's the physical pain of breaking a bone or the emotional turmoil that follows. During these difficult moments, it's easy for dark forces\u2014our fears, doubts, and painful memories\u2014to overwhelm us. But what truly matters is our ability to move forward each day, seeking to reconnect with our most loving and positive selves. In this pursuit, we can rediscover our inner strength and protection.\n\nAfter experiencing my divorce, I found myself engaging in reckless behaviors, which felt like a natural reaction to the confusion I was enduring. I found myself questioning my spiritual beliefs while careening down dark country roads and experimenting in risky situations, very much feeling adrift. Amidst the chaos, I sensed a miraculous protective presence watching over me. I\u2019ll never forget a moment when I took LSD during one of my lowest points and felt the presence of a guiding light\u2014almost like a seraphim keeping me safe.\n\nThis emotional journey took a heartbreaking turn when my grandfather took his own life in the very home that had once felt like a sanctuary. As I battled my own inner demons and struggled at my lowest, I made a reckless leap over a fence, believing I was in control, only to land hard and break both of my elbows. It was my first real injury, a vivid reminder that while I may think I\u2019m steering my own ship, the ocean remains unpredictable.\n\nDuring my painful recovery, I began to weave together the trauma of my experiences with the highs and lows of my past. It was during this time that I reconnected with my girlfriend, someone I had known long before my marriage. It felt like fate was offering me a second chance, even amidst the cost of my own struggles. Our rekindled relationship grew while I faced the loss of a job that had once defined my identity. My arrogance had pulled me deeper into old habits, but a tragic loss of a close friend eventually jolted me back to reality, reminding me of what truly matters.\n\nAs I look ahead to October 2025, when my girlfriend and I are expecting a child, I am filled with a sense of newfound clarity about life. Though I have faced many challenges, there's still a part of me that carries a weight of youthful naivety. My hope is to continue growing and learning with each passing year, embracing all of life's experiences.\n\nI understand that my journey may not resonate with everyone, but if any part of it touches you, I thank you for being here to listen. Remember, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, and it truly does get better. Trust the process and keep your heart open.",

I have an aunt and she's the smartest most level person i can talk to but even then she'll recite advice she heard from fox news or whatever. i was thinking about moving back to georgia and going to school in athens. maybe that'll be a better place to work on movies once i get the ball rolling. i just need to get away from everyone i just don't have much money to go to school because my dad has been dead for almost a decade and my mom hasn't had a job until lately for the past 10 years.",

I\u2019m extremely grateful that he pays the big ones rent, electric, car insurance and his car payment, the rest are on me. \nI work 6 days a week and I bring in more than some but yet not enough. I feel worthless only having <$300 in my savings and <$200 in checking. My dog has to go to the vet tomorrow and although she has insurance we haven\u2019t reached the deductible. \nI pay so many bills I don\u2019t have enough to get my own self insurance nor my husband ( he has through the VA but it sucks cause it\u2019s the VA ). My coworker is 20 and has 8k in savings. I have never had that kind of money. I\u2019ve been on my own since I was 16. I\u2019m an uninsured type 1 diabetic living in the states. How are people able to save that kind of money ? Vacations? Time off ? \nAgain, I\u2019m DROWNING at work but yet it\u2019s not enough. There\u2019s nowhere else hiring. I\u2019ve thought about going back to college because I think the VA would pay us for me to go and pay for college but I already have no time for myself. \nWe have 4 dogs and they\u2019ve started having issues. My husband has been sick for <1 year barely able to get out of bed some days, just enough to feed and let the dogs out. \nI\u2019m in so much debt. Credit cards/care credit alone it\u2019s about 7k my car is another story. \nSometimes the thought of death lingers and I think it\u2019s better than constantly stressing about money. I\u2019m always tired, I have no hobbies. I come home, take care of the dogs, cook dinner, and go to bed. My father a few months back had a suicide attempt due to how bad his money situation is and how bad my mother is with money. My husbands birthday is the end of the month and I\u2019ve been trying to work my ass off at work to make more money so we can do something fun but to no avail, I\u2019m just killing myself. \nHe wanted concert tickets and I felt bad shutting him down for the hundredth time due to money. \nHow do people focus on the good when the bad outweighs that ? \n\nOf course I have a roof over my head and food in my fridge. But I want to be able to breathe. Hell maybe have insurance so I know when I\u2019m getting good insulin that works or the lump in my breast checked out but I can\u2019t afford it. I make too much for Medicare but not enough to other plans. \n\nI know others have it worse but I can\u2019t bother him with this rant for the 100th time. It\u2019s bothering me particularly right now after hearing about my coworkers and their future vacations, future concerts, everything that I can\u2019t do, they\u2019re younger than me and have parents that support them etc etc. \nI\u2019m just so fucking tired all the time. I\u2019m 23 and I\u2019ve considered working 7 days every now and then. Thankfully my marriage hasn\u2019t taken too much of a hit but my husband doesn\u2019t love when I come home and just fall asleep sitting up. \n\nThis is all over the place.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, so this all started a few months ago. I'm not gonna say his real name so we'll call em KK. Kk is my older brother and we only share the same mom. So he visited us after moving out a while ago and then he and my mom started talking about how my uncle got prostate cancer. So I was really invested in this conversation. So then Kk asks \" how do you know what a prostate is?\" I simply ignored him. Then he asks \" do you know human anatomy.\" I said \" yes I do but don't ask me that.\" I was already starting to get weirdded out and very uncomfortable. Whilst he was getting up to get a plate, he asked me again \" do you know what the zygote process is?\" I simply pretended not to hear him and tell him facts about the human body that anyone would know. After he left, I was crying. Before this happened a few months ago, I told him jokingly I was a lesbian ( I'm still questioning) and since he's Pentecostal bc our family is, he said \" no, you're still young please don't be one.\" Which is so weird. Anyways a month or two ago, my mom made kk take me and my little brother to his house for the weekend since she had to go somewhere. While in the car, I watched something I shouldn't have. When we went back home, he exaggerated the details and said it wasn't adult film. First of all, it wasn't an adult film; it was a short. About 5-10 seconds. He caught me by looking through the window of the car and went through my entire phone. Emails, messages, photos ( mind you there could be sensitive information in my phone that he shouldn't be seeing). He also caught me messaging online friends. Nothing inappropriate, just discussing online games and platforms for people my age. My mom has internalized misogyny so she told me while lecturing me \" if you're doing this all at your age right now, what are you gonna be doing in a few years? Prostitution?\" My brother agreed. One of my online friends was a guy. Another was a girl but he didn't care to tell my mom that. I got my phone back and all but a few days ago, I overheard he and his friends talking about how kk is a player. He's presumably been in multiple relationships and sleeping with many girls. He even admitted to being a \" bop.\" I told him I wanted to check his phone and he screamed \" no! There's something in here you cannot see.\" But anyways that's it  ",

There\u2019s no need to go into detail about the recent arguments but they\u2019re mostly petty and localised around getting the wrong message from each other.\n\nToday i was faced with another minor misunderstanding, she was thinking we were to be at a location by a certain time. I mentioned that last i heard,our ETA was dependant on a third party.\nShe doubled down on what she heard so I asked where she got this information from and she clarified it was from me. Obviously some confusion occurred. During a few more back and forths about this, I must\u2019ve  raised my tone at some point because she said I was being rude.\n\nAt the end of what I would call yet another petty misunderstanding, she spent about 10 minutes telling me how easy it would be to find someone better than me, in every possible way. Then mentioned I may as well be homosexual and carried on a little bit about that. I had no words, except something about being treated like dog shit. \n\n",

You no longer gave me butterflies but there was still a softness in my heart for you. I wanted to see you succeed then and I still want to see you succeed now.

Dropping the thesis meant that I couldn\u2019t graduate with Latin honors despite having a 3.97 gpa.

But with anal, well... The first time was ok, but the next time it hurt like a motherfucker, and I almost started crying. \n\nThe day we had anal for the second time, I did something which was unexpected, even out of character for me. I rimmed my boyfriend. I was giving him a blowjob, and I slowly moved towards his butt. I was constantly watching his reactions to make sure I'm not doing anything bad or make him uncomfortable, but judging on his body language, I was pretty sure he was enjoying it. He even moved into a better position for me to do it, he put his ass right in my face. Then we tried to have anal, and it hurt me and we stopped everything.\n\nA couple of days later, he exploded out of the blue. He told me he wouldn't be pressuring me or forcing me to do anything anymore, definitely no more butt stuff. He went on to say that it's ok for a woman to get rimmed, that he likes my ass, but he's not gay, his body is different, that it's ok for a woman to rim another woman, but not a man, that he doesn't understand what some guys find so appealing about it, it's gross. \n\nHe then asked me \"Don't you think it's gross? Wouldn't you be grossed out if I eat your ass and then kiss you?\". I was so confused and on the verge of crying. I said \"But you've already done this so many times, you ate my ass and then kissed me, and you thought I was pulling away from you, and you got upset and forced me into kissing you because you said I shouldn't feel gross about you kissing me after eating my ass\".\n\nI asked him what I had done wrong, what was going on, was he ok, did I make him uncomfortable by rimming him and kissing him. He said no, but kept asking me again and again throughout the night \"Don't you think it's gross?\".\n\nBut the cherry on top was when he started talking about potentially having a baby. It was totally unrelated to the discussion we were having about anal stuff. I'm not on bc, so he just goes \"oh, btw, this pack of condoms is the last one we'll be using\". I thought he meant breaking up, but then he went on with \" If you get pregnant, well, it is what it is, it's up to you to decide if you keep it or not\". Aaaand a couple of minutes later \" you know, I don't want to leave you to raise a baby alone, I keep thinking what if something happens, what if I die or something, I don't want you to be alone with a baby\".\n\nWhat the fuck, man?! What is going on in that sick mind of his? All this discussion feels like a fever dream, it's surreal and absurd.\n\nI cried myself to sleep last night. He is driving me crazy, he is mentally torturing me, and I honestly believe he is insane, like literally, medically insane. I can't understand him. What the hell is going on? Why is it ok when he forces me to do all sorts of things even though I clearly express my discomfort verbally and through body language, and then he is outraged when I do things to him?! Why does he treat me like this, and then talks about having a baby, one minute not giving a shit about it, and the next minute being so concerned about me, us, the imaginary baby. I can't fucking do this anymore!",

    "selftext": "His parents are not on the best terms and often fight. His mom has been through her own struggles and doesn\u2019t know how to handle a child. She is also very manipulative and doesn\u2019t treat her child well; she has been hitting him since he was a baby, even for just crying. My nephew, on the other hand, is a bundle of joy, but when he was a baby, he hardly ever smiled. As he grew up, he became more aggressive, especially towards animals. When his mother shouts at him, he doesn\u2019t flinch or even look at her; he continues doing whatever he was doing. She just yells at him, and he seems unfazed. He doesn't care if she takes away his toys, limits his TV time, or tells him to go to bed early. He simply says \"okay\" or \"bye,\" laughing when he misbehaves. I believe this is an anxiety reaction.\n\nHis mother constantly gets angry in front of him. My brother, while not shouting, also isn\u2019t much better. No one plays with him or shows him enough love. I try my best to be there for him, and he genuinely loves me, which makes me very happy. He listens to me and never behaves badly with me; it's only with her. I\u2019ve noticed that he treats her as if he were a bad child, while with me he is an angel. Yes, he might act out occasionally, but I never shout at him. He is just a child who doesn\u2019t understand this world yet and relies on us for everything. I could never shout at or hit a child.\n\nToday, they had a big fight, and my brother is considering divorce. I feel lost about what to do. This is just a quick note; my family pretty much agrees that she needs professional help. She came to us when things escalated and shared her side of the story, but without context. When we heard my brother's account, it was a completely different story. Yes, my brother has been at fault for some things, but she has been overreacting in many ways. \n\nI want to help my nephew. I feel like he may have behavioral disorders, and I want him to know he is loved and wanted by many. I just want him to grow up feeling cherished, but I\u2019m unsure how to achieve that.",

    "selftext": "All names in this story are fake and this is a throwaway account.\n\nI've never been a \"people person.\" I'm very introverted, so much so that I used to get scared to say anything in a classroom because I was so nervous. While I've grown out of some of my shyness, I don't consider myself close to many people. My group of close friends is about five people. Me, three female friends, and one male, who is the boyfriend of one of my friends. I had been closer friends with two of the females (we'll call them Elizabeth and Mary) and more recently this year, I became friends with the other female and her boyfriend (Ariana and Justin). \n\nMy female friends and I would have sleepovers with each other for fun and I always felt like I was the excluded one. When we wanted to play games, my game was prioritized last. Most of the time, we never even played it. I would suggest a place to get dinner or snacks to get for our night and they would always be rejected. I thought, okay fine, it's just that not everybody else wants that or prefers something else. But then it started developing into more.\n\nWe had always been friendly with Justin, but not close with him until recently after spending some time with him. In particular, my friend Mary has gotten very close with him because they have similar senses of humor. Ever since he joined the group, it felt like I was no longer in it. We like to play video games, but most of them are four player. I was always the one that got kicked out of the group. Recently, Ariana, Justin, and Mary were hanging out and Ariana texted me asking me to join them so that they could have four people for Mario party (Elizabeth was busy). Maybe this is a little sensitive of me, but it made me feel like an afterthought so that they could have more fun. Had they had Elizabeth there, I bet I wouldn't have been invited at all.\n\nThis has happened a lot of times. I will hear them talking about hanging out and I will realize that I was the only one who wasn't invited. Like I said, I'm not a super social person, so the first few times, it didn't bother me. But after quite a few hangouts without me, I started to feel purposely excluded. I can help but feel like them excluding me is my fault.\n\nA few weeks prior to Justin becoming a part of our group, the four of us girls had a sleepover together. Usually, we split our hostess's bed and then split either a couch or an inflatable bed. I was paired with Mary for this particular time and made jokes about us sleeping in the bed (I know I have the humor of a 10-year-old boy). My friend was not uncomfortable by these jokes as she laughed and oftentimes added onto them, plus I had made these jokes before and she had not asked me to stop, so I assumed that it was okay. But then Mary started getting physical.\n\nI don't mean like we were having sex, but she would drag her hand down my arm or try to pull me next to her when we were in bed. I definitely wouldn't consider these sexually charged, but I was very uncomfortable with them. I made it clear, at least I thought, by asking her to stop multiple times. I stopped with my jokes too, because I assumed that encouraged her. Touch is a really big deal for me and I'm not comfortable with most people touching me. Mary continued to keep stroking me and overall just irritating me after I had asked her to stop.\n\nI kind of snapped and asked her to stop. I told her that I would no longer sleep in the bed with her and I'd rather sleep on the floor than in a bed with her. Apparently, Mary took this very personally. Ever since, Elizabeth and Ariana have been distancing themselves from me. This is when most of the hang outs without me started and when I truly felt excluded.\n\nI'm not a very affectionate person. I don't tell people that I love them and I really don't like people touching me without permission. I'll say nice things and let people know I care about them, but I have a very hard time telling people that I love them and letting them in. But now I feel like this is all my fault. I feel like me not being open to joking physically impedes me from being closer friends with them. I've always felt like I was kind of the \"back up\" friend, and now I just think it's because I'm not a good friend at all.",

    "selftext": "You and I were friends. Yes I did like you a few months back. But now I had moved on. Saw you just as a friend. You told me you're too religious to date or have sex before marriage, I thought okay. To me, I still found in you a non judgmental place to confide in. I told you about every guy I was with. Or the guy who came after me. I loved talking to you. I didn't want you to talk everyday. But I wish we could have met and have a quality conversation once in a while like we did have in the beginning about.. just life in general. But you insisted we text everyday. If i tried pulling back youd want me right here. Even if you dated or had sex I wouldn't have given a shit. It was your life. You could have dealt with it the way I did- didn't I ask you if we could still hang out if I get a boyfriend? You said we could if he was fine. That was a fair enough response.\n\nNow in the middle of the night you call me, when \nI know you never call. You never do. So I know something was off. You had instances where you mentioned doing things with a \"friend\" but I felt deep inside it was too much care you held for a friend.. but I thought okay, you have been there for your classmates as well. I didn't pay it much heed and blindly trusted you. But that call changed everything. She said she was your girlfriend. She said you've been having a lot of sex. And you asked me so many questions in an attempt to clarify to her that we were just friends.\n\nYou could have been transparent to us both about it and then this issue would never have arose. But I don't think you realize the betrayal that hurt me still stings physically in my chest. You know I have a history of self harm. And you went leaps and bounds to hurt me in the same way. You don't realize how much it hurt me when you said, \"I don't think we should be talking. I think I'd block you from everywhere.\" You do realize how shitty that made me feel. That what bond we had was not even good enough to fight for? Not even half a fight for? Like I was some use and throw and always people would choose someone else over me. I know it's your girlfriend and I know in that moment I couldn't say anything but \"okay\".\n\nBut I think it might have mattered to you a bit. Cause you didn't really block me. I did, in a moment of rage. Then came the feeling of losing a friend and... I needed a closure. I called you. You still asked the same questions even when I didn't accuse you of any of it- \"did I ever flirt with you or lead you on etc etc etc\" I wasn't asking about THOSE you dumb shit. I wanted to know why you couldn't tell me about having someone else in your life the way I told you about the thesis guy who came after me. We were still friends after him weren't we? Then how casually did you say before ending the call, \"I don't think I'll ever talk to you again\" \n\nI want to believe I sensed some hesitation in that sentence. But what else could I say in reply except \"okay\". We always had such clear communication but I couldn't even express how hurt I felt.\n\nYOU have someone to rely on while you push me away. I don't. I miss the void of our friendship. I didn't care if we spoke once in six months.. I told you that.. I have other friends who are the same.. but you just.. cut me off.. in one go..\n\nWas I that dispensible? \n\nWhy wouldn't you be clear to both of us about us. You could have told us. What did you get keeping it that way? I don't know how to deal with any of it except SH. It had happened a month before.. and now again.. I'm not blaming you.. but I wish.. and I want to know why...\n\nYou said you didn't tell me cause you thought you'd sound like a hypocrite? That not dating and no sex thing? Cmon you know me better than that.. and that was the lamest reason I could have heard. But okay. Idk why...\n\nGOD WHY ME!? WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU FOR THIS TO HAPPEN EVERY TIME?

He is also almost certainly undiagnosed schizophrenic with delusions of grandeur (I was a psych major with a neuroscience concentration, and worked with other people with Grandiose Delusional Disorder), and refuses to accept that just because HE feels good, he's not in a normal or regulated state. He has very little accountability for his actions.\n\nHe's had several attempts to take his own life and hospitalizations. He doesn't understand that it's not that everyone in his life hates and abandons him, it's that he leans on everyone so hard that the relationship can't support it, and then when they cant deal anymore, he moves on to the next kindhearted soul who will tolerate him for a while. But I've done my time, and I can't deal anymore. I'm the person who has stuck it out the longest including most of his family, and my concern is that I'm the last domino, and it will destroy him if I leave. i know my first responsibilities are to myself, my job, and my reciprocal friendships, but I feel terrible knowing that something I did \"caused\" someone else to die. And I'm not sure, if it happens, how I'll get over it, but I know that right now it's just an \"if\" and I can't pretend it's already happened when I don't know for sure. Just something I needed to get out there.\n\nThanks for listening internet <3",

    "selftext": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n\nI (25F now) was sa\u2019d as a child by a man I met through Omegle. \n\nI was 15 years old and he was 53. He had a wife and a daughter who was only three years younger than I was at the time. We met January of 2015 through Omegle. I didn\u2019t have really any friends at the time and I was going through personal family struggles so I turned to the internet to make friends. Tale as old as time\u2026 \n\nI would say it started off pretty sexual within a week. I liked the older male attention he was giving me. Wemoved over to Skype right away and that\u2019s how we communicated from then on. Every day after school I would get online and guess who would also be online? \u2026 duh. \nWe would chat for an hour before he had to get off because his wife would be coming home from work. He was a retired marine who just owned businesses so he didn\u2019t really have to leave the house during the day if he didn\u2019t want to. \n\nI started to really fall in love with the idea of this guy. (I thought it was real love for him at the time) My days revolved around getting home from school to webcam with him. That\u2019s all I cared about. \n\nOne night we were texting on Skype while I had music playing on my phone. I accidentally fell asleep and my phone was lying on my chest. \nI woke up maybe a hour later or however long (it was still nighttime) and I couldn\u2019t find my phone anywhere. I searched and searched and had this bad feeling that maybe my mom had my phone. I barged in her room demanding her tell me where my phone is. She then asks me if I need to tell her anything. I obviously play dumb knowing where this is going. Long story short, she went in my room, heard music playing and went to turn it off and that\u2019s when she saw all the messages of our texts and she screenshotted them all, sent them into the FBI and took my phone from me for 3 weeks. It was really embarrassing and I was sick to my stomach knowing my mom saw all our messages to each other because they were very sexual. \nAnyways, I kept chatting with him through my school laptop (she obviously didn\u2019t know this). He didn\u2019t seem too bothered when I told him she sent the texts in to the FBI. \n\nMonths go by, and nothing seems to have come from my mom sending in the messages to the FBI so out of sight out of mind, it kinda just never crossed my mind again. \n\nHe then messaged me sometime in May saying he wanted to plan to come meet me In person (he lived a couple states away at the time, so about a 8 hour drive) so we made the plan. It would be right when school would let out in June. \n\nSo around June he drove down to meet me. I stayed at my grandma\u2019s house while my mom was out of town on a work thing and my dad and sister went on the annual summer beach trip (obviously my dad was a little sussed out that I turned down the beach vacation to go stay with grandma but I really sold it to them that I just didn\u2019t feel like going that year) \n\nSo the plan was I would wait till midnight and sneak him through the window of my bedroom at my grandma\u2019s every night. \nSo everything went to plan. For every night for three nights from midnight to 5 am he would come in the guest bedroom where I was staying and have sex with me \u2026. This was the first time I ever had a sexual encounter in my life and he took my virginity. At the time, I thought I wanted this. Looking back now I feel so bad for young me. I was a child. At the time though, 15 \u2026 I thought I was so mature. \n\nSo he got away with it basically and drove back to his house and we kept chatting. \nTwo weeks after our meeting, my mom called me downstairs one morning and there were two official looking people sitting on the couch. My mom informed me that they were FBI agents for child sexual crimes online and they flew in from his state to talk to me. \nI thought at this point that maybe someone knew something about our meeting. \nHowever, after talking with them for 5 min, it seemed they didn\u2019t know, and they were just following up on the screenshots my mom had sent them months prior. \nI stalled as much as I could and gave them wrong information regarding his location, address, usernames, emails, etc\u2026 I\u2019m sure they could tell I was lying. Anyways, they left after like 30 min. I immediately ran to my phone to inform him that the FBI were looking into the messages between us and asking info about him. \n\nHe texted me back \n\u201cStay put. I\u2019m coming to get you. Go to your grandma\u2019s. Remember the plan?\u201d \n\nWell the plan he came up with was that if anything ever happened he would leave his family, drive down to come pick me up and we would drive out west to live in a cabin in a secluded area until I turned 18 or things were \u201cnormal\u201d. He mentioned this to me months prior but I never thought it would ever get to this point. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I went along with it but I did. I loved him and didn\u2019t want him to get in trouble. \n\nI immediately went to my grandma\u2019s house. I only had one backpack full of clothes, wrote a note saying I was running away, waited for his text that he was down the street, left my phone and exited from the window. Mind you, at this time it\u2019s around midnight. \nI ran down the street, saw his truck and hopped in. He showed me his gun, and this did kind of alert me in a way but not totally out of the norm because I knew he had guns being former military and a hunter. (Looking back now though, him letting me know he had a gun was definitely an intimidation tactic) \n\nWe started driving down the road and I asked him where we were going\u2026 he threw out maybe Utah\u2026 Wyoming. Somewhere isolated so we don\u2019t get caught. \n\nAt that point it became so real to me. I kind of started to internally panic. I realized I\u2019m a freshman in high school. I won\u2019t see my family again. I won\u2019t finish high school. What is going to happen? \n\nNot even 5 minutes down the road, a police car started to pull us over. Apparently an out of state license plate on a speeding car at midnight is kinda a red flag. He pulled over and told me to tell them he\u2019s my uncle and we are going to McDonald\u2019s. (All I could think of was what happens if they don\u2019t believe me, is he going to pull his gun out and have a shootout with the police?) I do as I\u2019m told. But obviously they didn\u2019t believe me and asked me to step out. I tried to keep saying he was my uncle but then they asked for my ID which I had to comply. They then asked for my parents numbers to confirm he was my uncle. Long story short, I think he realizes there is no way out of this and he admits to them that I\u2019m a friend from the internet and they take him that night for contributing to delinquency of a minor. \n\nThe next few days is a blur. I just remember being inconsolable because I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to him. \n\n2 days later, my parents tell me I\u2019m \u201cmandated by the police\u201d to go to a therapy session. This is how naive I was. I had no idea the potential of them trying to get more information out of me. \n\nI ended up telling the therapist we met weeks prior, and had sex every night for three nights. I tell her this thinking it\u2019s confidential.  As soon as I leave the room, the fbi agents come up to me and say they have to inform me that the session was being recorded video and audio and will be used as my testimony in court so I don\u2019t have to appear. I lost my mind, yelling at them screaming that they lied and made me throw him under the bus. \n\nThey then slapped on more charges, 2 counts of carnal knowledge, 2 more counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and indecent exposure. This was the information they needed to put him away. \n\n\nThe district attorney started showing me evidence that I wasn\u2019t the only one. That I wasn\u2019t \u201cspecial\u201d. I was so angry at these people thinking they took him away from me. Made me throw him under the bus. I thought he must hate me. \n\nIt took me over a year to get over it. To get over him. For me to believe the evidence they were showing me that he was talking to other girls at the same time as me \u2026 some as young as 9 years old. \n\nThe district attorney also told me that he implicated himself. He asked me if I knew that he had been writing a book. I obviously said no, and he said they had raided his house and found on his computer that he wrote over 200+ pages of a book he was writing where it was about him and I and running away. Kind of like a Lolita-esque book about him and I\u2019s story of everything and it lined up with everything I told them. He said he implicated himself regardless and that I shouldn\u2019t feel bad. \n\nI was devastated when I realized it was the truth. That I was groomed. That he was talking to other girls, even younger than me. That I wasn\u2019t special. \n\nThey found an insane amount of ammunition in his truck. And the cops who pulled us over that night got the life saver award that year in the city for apparently saving my life because they thought I would never be seen alive again. \n\nHe went to jail for 5 years. Put on sex offender registry for life. The judge made it very clear to him that if he ever tried to contact me again, she will put him in jail for life. \n\n\nFast forward to 2020, he gets out. I didn\u2019t know what I expected. \n\nI found his daughter on Instagram looking up her name. 2022: Saw a picture of him and his wife. The same wife he was leaving that night for good. The daughter captioned it \u201chappy anniversary\u2026 I love you guys so much\u201d \n\nI\u2019m so confused how the wife didn\u2019t leave him. How did he cajole her into staying with him? Did he lie and say he wasn\u2019t leaving her for good that night? She\u2019s ok with having a husband who assaulted a 15 year old? Idk how to feel about it. It\u2019s very confusing. Hurtful. \n\n\nSorry this is such a long story I just needed to get it off my chest. There is more details if anyone wants it. But yeah, I\u2019m 25 now. It\u2019s been 10 years and this still affects me on a daily basis. ",

    "selftext": "I'm sure it's been done before, but I feel like an asshole for it. This is a family member of mine who died around ten years ago and one I looked up to very much. We didn't spend much time together, only when they could visit maybe a handful of times a year. They died before I left for college, so I would've seen even less of them. However, they indirectly helped mold my personality into what it is today\u2014how I feel about friendships, taking care of others. Being a person that leaves a good impact and tries their best despite obstacles, because it's worth a better life.\n\nFast forward to now and...I don't think I've ever felt so exhausted or burnt out at work before in my life (32/F). My workplace offers PTO for a family member's death, and more days if it's a nuclear family member. I'd take the days if they were unpaid, but the company doesn't do that. Muscling through it's never worked for me in the past. I'm not built of discipline like my partner. I need times to catch my breath and I had to use most of my PTO already for a sickness earlier in the year. You don't get unpaid time in my position. If you're out, it eats your PTO, so you have to choose if you want to get sick and lose vacation time. I just need a damn break.\n\nMy rationalization is that I'm not just sitting on my ass. I'm going to do the housework and maintain things, because I'll be at home. I'm going to write down my stresses, visualize the list and figure out what's impacting me and what I can do about it. Use the time to actually get a decent sleep schedule\u2014I barely sleep on weekdays because I lose time to work, so I feel like staying up is the only way to reclaim my time. Cook more, take care of myself. Put away the piles of laundry I pick from the top of every day instead of putting away.\n\nIt doesn't make the central prospect any less fraudulent or karmically negative. I can only hope that using it to improve my life in some way honors my family member's death.",

    "selftext": "\nWhen I was 6/7 years old I was sa\u2019d by a boy in my class. I haven\u2019t fully remembered it yet because I\u2019m scared to but I know it happened and how bad I felt at the time. It was a lot more than what I did to my brother, we hid under tables during lunch, making out multiple times, I think I agreed at first but it became much more. I remember feeling stuck/frozen at the time and I\u2019m not sure how many times it happened, I know I never told anyone though.\n\nWhen I was either 9 or 10, I was outside playing truth or dare with my brother who was 4 or 5. I dared him to let me kiss him and he said no. I proceeded to ask a few more times please and he kept saying no. I remember not wanting to do anything at all just that I felt like I had to, I didn\u2019t think at all that it was wrong or could hurt him, just that I was being annoying. I did care about his feelings and didn\u2019t want to hurt him at all, I was very confused and didn\u2019t understand what I was doing, If I knew it was wrong at the time I wouldn\u2019t have brought the idea up whatsoever. I soon realised I should stop asking and that I really didn\u2019t have to do anything so I walked away to go back inside the house. He then said wait and that he\u2019d changed his mind. I was hesitant but because I didn\u2019t realise that he was most likely pressured and that\u2019s why he agreed I didn\u2019t think of it as a big deal so I quickly kissed him on the lips. I felt and still feel so disgusted thinking about it even though it didn\u2019t happen again and didn\u2019t go any further than a peck. I didn\u2019t tell him not to tell anyone/threaten him and I don\u2019t think I tried to make it seem like a secret at all. I believe this all happened because of what happened to me, I\u2019m not saying this is an excuse at all just an explanation.\n\nImmediately afterwards he went and told our mum that I kissed him. She asked him if he was okay and he assured her he was, just that he was confused why I\u2019d want a kiss. She came and asked me about it and I remember feeling very stressed like I was about to cry even though she told me everything was okay. I was confused and assumed I\u2019d done something wrong (which I did) just because she was asking me, otherwise why would she? He\u2019s 13 now and remembers what happened clearly and still says he\u2019s fine with what happened and wasn\u2019t hurt. I know he could still be hurt and realise this once he\u2019s older, if so how could I help him?\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, I forgot about this for a while because other people on Reddit have told me it wasn\u2019t cocsa but I used ai bots to ask about the incident which said it most likely was. I don\u2019t want to victimise myself, I just need to know the truth and if I should kill myself or not. I\u2019ve already asked my brother about the event multiple times because I have ocd and people convinced me that it wasn\u2019t harmful so I didn\u2019t think it would matter that I did ask him about it.\n\nDoes anyone think my brother could be harmed from this? My mum and him really don\u2019t think so and he thinks I\u2019m making a big deal out of nothing but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to live with myself if he really was.\n\nSomeone downvoted me, does that mean I should kill myself??",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m in my early 20s and am a biology major. The beginning of the semester, this girl starts talking to me excessively. I didn\u2019t think much of it. I think she was in one of my classes last semester but I never interacted with her. For context, I go to an EXTREMELY small liberal arts college\u2026like\u2026the biology professors know most (if not all) the student body. So this adds conflict. The girl starts talking to me and I think nothing of it. I thought it would be a good opportunity to make connections with my lab partner (she\u2019s my lab partner as well) so that we can collaborate better. However, she would make weird comments whenever I answered or asked questions in class. She would say stuff like \u201cI don\u2019t like how the professor treats you\u201d or \u201cI can tell the professor was judging you when you answered\u201d and \u201cI can tell you were lost.\u201d Even though I didn\u2019t notice any of those things. She then would\u2026not stalk me\u2026but just seemed really weird to me. Like, she was able to figure out my car when she was driving BEHIND me and then tried to pass me (illegally) to \u201cconfirm it was me.\u201d She then started parking right next to me. It was a little weird, but I rolled with it. She would also try to\u2026almost like isolate me\u2026from the class. Like one time, we divided into groups, and the professor was gonna put me in another group and the girl actually tried to ARGUE WITH HIM saying I should stay in her group. But things didn\u2019t get weird until one night, when we were suppose to be working on a lab assignment. I was at home and we called on the phone. She started talking about her sex life in detail, but THEN she started saying how I LOOK LIKE HER LOVER (the person she sleeps with) and then starts saying weird shit like \u201cI noticed you in zoology last semester\u201d and then she started asking if I was gay\u2026and when I said no and that I dated a guy before\u2026she was all like \u201cthat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She mentions she has crushes on all her friends. She said some other stuff that was weird\u2026and I was weirded out by her. So I started distancing myself from her. I didn\u2019t want to lead her on and intimacy scares me, so the fact she started comparing me to her sex partner made me uncomfortable. However, she would send constant text messages and phone calls. She was getting overwhelming. She then tried to invite me to her house to \u201chang out\u201d for a few hours inbetween classes. I said no and that was when I was like \u201cshit I think you need to avoid her.\u201d \n\nSo I did. I ignored her calls if she ever talked about anything not-school related. However, a couple of weeks ago, I was in lab and I didn\u2019t seem dead inside, so she starts harassing me and starts insisting she buys coffee. I ignore her text message and her offer\u2026and yeah. She\u2019s been making my life hell in lab. We had to do a project together\u2026and she EXCLUDED ME FROM THE PROJECT. She and this other girl would meet privately to get it done, and when I went to present, I froze and left lol. I eventually mentioned to the professor that I didn\u2019t want to be lab partners anymore. The thing is, she\u2019s not like that to the other classmates. She talks to them about biology things and about school things. At most, she mentions her one partner. But she always seems to want to be alone with me. It\u2019s weird. I probably am I fault though. I struggle setting boundaries so that\u2019s been annoying. Anyways, I hate going to class and I just don\u2019t like being alone with her cause she always finds a way to isolate me from the world and I don\u2019t want to be alone with her.

    "selftext": "I was with my partner for 12 years\u20146 years dating, 6 years married. I thought our relationship was going well, aside from the usual small disagreements that every couple has. We had even started planning to have a child, something we had postponed due to our careers.\n\nThen, one random day, I found videos on his computer\u2014videos of him in our home, in our bed, with escorts. My whole world shattered in an instant. Whenever I was away for work trips or visiting my family, he was bringing escorts into our house and filming everything.\n\nHe admitted to doing this for the past two years (which probably means it\u2019s been even longer). He never once discussed any issues with me. Instead, he lived a parallel life behind my back. On top of everything, we were actively trying for a child and he never even considered the risk of exposing me to STDs. I was lucky to test negative, but the sheer disregard for my health and trust is something I can\u2019t process.\n\nWhen I confronted him, he said he has a porn addiction and that our relationship wasn\u2019t \"enough\" for him. But he never once talked to me about this and he just made the decision to go behind my back for years.\n\nWhat makes this even harder is that it\u2019s not just me who was blindsided. My entire family and all of our mutual friends were just as shocked. He hid this part of himself so well that no one suspected a thing. He acted like the perfect husband, the perfect friend, the perfect son-in-law, all while leading a completely separate life behind closed doors.\n\nWe got divorced immediately. I left everything behind. It\u2019s over. But my anger hasn\u2019t faded. The images of those videos are burned into my mind. I try to distract myself to move on but I don\u2019t know how to erase these memories from my head.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been through something similar, how do you let go of something like this?",

    "selftext": "It's been a turbulent year to say the least. About this time last year, I was in my final year of college and on track to graduate a year early. All I had left was a capstone internship, and instead of a position within the agency I was working for part time, I decided to move halfway across the country to a small town for what should have been a dream opportunity.\n\nYou see, I had been recently dumped and needed to get away from the city and the memories, so when an opportunity came to pursue a niche area of my career field as a means to finish my degree, I jumped at the opportunity. The summer went fine, I love the slower pace of the country, and at the end of the summer I had a full time job offer. Everything was falling into place, but soon enough this isolated life I had built would feel like a prison. After I was hired full time, the illusion was shattered at work. It was a small workforce, about 10 people in total woking there full time including me. The two directors who had been welcoming all summer started to show their true colors, and I found myself in a toxic environment. I started looking for a way out, and just in time I found a new job with better pay in the same industry.\n\nThe new job has been brilliant. My coworkers are amazing, and it feels like I can breathe again, yet something isn't right. I have, by all logic, come out of this situation better than I started it. I graduated a year ahead of my peers, and while many of my friends are scrambling to find jobs and figure out their lives I have a stable job that I love and an apartment of my own. I am grateful for all of this, and I have everything that I need. My finances are stable, there are opportunities for growth in my career, and I am finally feeling comfortable being single and on my own.\n\nThere's a problem with all of this though: I feel empty. Not in a depressed way though, I've struggled with mental illness in my past but have it managed now. It just feels like I've spent my college years working and building this life while my friends were out partying and traveling the world. I never took vacations during college. My spring, winter, and summer breaks were all spent working. I don't regret this, though, as I do truly believe I will be better off in the long run for it. I am happy that things are looking up for me, but right now I just feel like a robot. I wake up, I work, I come home. I make dinner, sometimes I go to the gym, sometimes I read. I don't have much of a social life, and I don't care for one, never have. This is everything I want in life, but now that I'm here I don't know what to do. Life is fucked, and I'm only 22.",

    "title": "Is it worth searching for a diagnostic?",
    "selftext": "Ok, so basically, I've been spiraling on it for more than a year now, and I need to take it off my chest. I'm starting to suspect I might be on the spectrum. I even pointed out a few things that used to be normal but now are really bothering me (the first one is getting out of control), so bear with me, please. If it's useful, I'm 22F. I've been like this ever since I can remember, but now I'm starting to realize weird looks whenever I comment what I do and people om my social group go \"hey um... I don't do that\". Those things were never a problem before, I saw them as quirks when I was a teenager, but now, as an adult, everyone seems to point this things out. They're bubbling on the surface. \n\n\n1. I speak to myself, like, a lot. Shamefully a lot. Way more than when I talk to real people. I replay dialogues, be it from shows or real life, be it two people or five. I fake interactions, I fake scenarios, I try to mimic other people's way of speech. I genuinely can portray 4 people myself included in a conversation WITH myself. It's getting so hard I have to watch myself not to do it in public. Specially at work because I work with kids so I need to pay attention. I simply fail on finding the trigger for this. It comes out as natural as breathe. I could easily say everything I'm typing out loud with no second thought. Be it in english or in portuguese, and I was highly invested at learning LIBRAS so I could have a third language to speak to myself (I feel like I still do it, even with my reduced vocabulary). Add on that mix that I clap. It gets faster the more excited I am. I never noticed I did that until my grandmother pointed out how LOUD I was clapping (I was 18). I even have a favorite way of clapping (something no one I know have. I asked.). \n\n\n2. I have weird interests. Like, ultra niche. The way I need to know who's the japanese voice actor behind any anime character I come across is overwhelming. The same goes for brazilian voice actors in movies. Always the men. I feel genuine relief when I know for a fact (after checking beforehand) that I don't know any voice actor from the show I'd be watching. My mom once said that she loves when she asks me \"whose is this voice\" and I can pinpoint three familiar characters with ease. That being said: I need to know every character of Takehito Koyasu. He's my favorite. And I'm on a mission of watch every piece of media this man had ever worked in. Some aren't even available online. Another one is an obsession towards Dorohedoro. I aim to own Dorohedoro in three languages (japanese, portuguese and english), just because. I want all figures. I want it all. I need it under my skin. I want it dissolved in my DNA. \n\n\n3. I fail at social cues. Not all the time. But, if someone say \"don't talk to me outside work\", even if the whole room knows it's a joke, and I know too, I'll never talk to this person outside work (unless they talk to me first, and I prey to God they don't). I have a hard time understanding irony and mischievous undertones, like fake compliments. I usually take them as genuine before someone points out that the person was just being nasty. Even when I know said person is known for being nasty, I always think \"oh, they were being nice this time\". One time at work, my boss told me how to proceed on a subjective situation that required judgement, and she gave me an example that I followed for dear life (Ex: If a kid is throwing a tantrum, instead of soothing her like an adult would attempt to, I'd call someone, because that's what she told me to do). A coworker pointed this out about me and it still bugs me because, for God's sake, what the hell am I supposed to do?\n\n\n4. I dislike consuming new media. I'm a animanga girl. I have my attachments (or hated ones), and I constantly fail to initiate something new. Even when everyone around me is too hyped up. So, if I'm willing to watch something new, you can be sure I did a weird level research beforehand. The studio, the voice actors, the staff... I know what I'm watching with some passion. Example: I watched Jujutsu Kaisen 3 years later its release. I even read the manga beforehand. Simply because I didn't want to \"walk in foreign soil.\"\n\nExtra notes:  I've been with my therapist for a long time now, and I remember I told her that I was suspicious about having ADHD and she dismissed it almost right away, claiming that everyone might have a little bit of everything. This time, I even took an AQ test and scored 36. I'm too nervous to think about it, because I don't want to look like those people that joke \"huh I might be autistic too haha i hate noise\". Like, for real.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm seeing things, if I'm thinking too hard, but honestly, I'm not sure if it's understandable for me to consider this (there are a few things missing out because, again, those I mentioned are what stick out the most) and what do I do if my therapist comes with this response again. To be honest, I don't even want to think about it. I started doing therapy to stop this \"talking to myself\" thing and guess what? Never ended, thriving as ever. But maybe that's my fault too because whenever I talk to her, it's only what I want to talk and I guess that's why I don't even remember I talk to myself. \n\n\nTLDR: I suspect I might be on the spectrum, I don't know if what I have is enough to justify my suspicion and I have no idea how to bring this to my therapist.",

    "selftext": "This will undoubtedly be one of the hardest things I've ever written. I'm unsure if I am doing this to seek reassurance, get an idea of what people feel, or some combination of the two.\n\nThis fear started when I was probably 24-25 (I am 35 now). It was around the time the Woody Allen sexual assault news came out. I remember thinking that some part of me was like Woody Allen and that I could commit something like that. I don't know where the thought came from or why it came there, but I think I was feeling guilty about two relationships:\n\n1. When I was a senior in college (21), I dated a 16-year-old girl (turned 17 when dating), whom I worked with. This was for a few months over the summer/beginning of my last semester in college. We got to 1st/2nd base to the best of my memory. I remember liking and being interested in her, and at the time (I swear to you), I didn't think it too weird. We worked together, and I felt more like a peer to her. That is not to say that I feel this way now- I have a lot of regret and shame about doing this, and for most of what I am sharing here.\n2. After this, I had another relationship with a girl who was 17 and I was 22. To the best of my memory, this relationship lasted for around four months. This relationship was more serious in terms of what we did\u2014while we didn't have sex, we probably got somewhere between second and third base. This was someone I knew who went to my high school, whom I met when seeing some friends/acquaintances there. This ended for many reasons, mainly because I was unsure about the relationship.\n\nThese two events mostly stayed out of my conscious awareness until the time mentioned above. I thought this meant that there was something seriously wrong with me. I also noticed that my crushes were usually, if not always, younger than me. I cannot remember how, but this led me to search all sorts of things and possible reasons why, and it eventually corresponded to an article about prenatal testosterone influencing the ratio of a person's index and ring finger. Basically, people have longer ring fingers than index fingers, and this ratio is more pronounced in men because they were exposed to greater testosterone in the womb.\n\nI then started measuring my fingers and found that my ratio was abnormal. In other words, I wish(ed) my ring finger were longer. I think I also found an article that said that men with high digit ratios were more likely to be pedophiles. However, I now think I misread it and instead read an article that said they were more likely to endorse paraphilic tendencies. Needless to say, I would spend a lot of time measuring my fingers-- first with a ruler, then with a picture on my phone, and finally, I would make photocopies of my hand to measure or digital scans of my hand to measure them digitally. I can't tell you how much time I spent on this. Hours and hours. I also developed a severe anxiety being around children, my libido in general tanked, and I started checking to see who I was even attracted to. This all led to the point of me holding a knife in my living room and seriously considering killing myself for being this way.\n\nFortunately, I didn't do that. Another thing happened during this time, and I became extremely anxious about being in relationships. During this time, I got into an on-again/off-again relationship and became so anxious about whether this person was right for me. This ended badly (she basically cheated on me). The pain from this was extreme. I remember crying at 1 AM on some random street. I started smoking and was probably at my lowest point.\n\nI'm not sure how, but I think the pain from the relationship, a career change, and a long-distance move slowly took my mind away from the stuff around my sexuality. I moved halfway across the country to start grad school and soon met someone of a similar age. We dated for almost two years, with the same fears about it being \"right\" or \"good enough.\" This relationship felt very safe and was my longest relationship to date; however, I felt something was missing, even though I didn't know what. I was attracted to this person, so that wasn't it, although sex was a bit boring sometimes. I also really didn't like her nipples (I know this is random, but I'm just trying to be as transparent as possible).\n\nBy the time I finished my master's and moved again for my doctoral program, I had ended this relationship and the stuff around my sexuality and hands was gone. I didn't think about it; it didn't worry me. I met various girls off-and-on for 1.5 years before meeting my next girlfriend, who was 25 when I was 28. I found her attractive and was pretty smitten with her the first few weeks, but slowly, the same anxieties came around this relationship. Mainly not feeling \"in love\" enough, worrying about fit, etc. We dated on and off for two years. I cared about and loved this person, and this relationship was one I look back on and think it \"got away.\" I loved this person deeply and miss her.\n\nAfter this relationship, I was single for a year and moved to finish my degree. This was when COVID came back again. I was struggling with isolation and also the ending of my previous relationship. I wasn't dating because I knew I would only be where I was for a year. I was struggling a lot with my mental health, but the stuff about attraction and hands didn't come up until the tail end of that year. I remember it very vividly. I was watching a British detective show, and one of the characters was attracted to a high school student and was the episode's villain. He was a stereotypical creepy guy, and I remember thinking, \"Well, I'm attracted to that girl.\"\n\nThis situation filled me with a lot of anxiety, and the process with my hands and attraction started, but in a slightly different way, where I wasn't worried about my attraction to children, but my attraction to teens, as well as intensely measuring my hands and looking at other people's hands. This continued when I started my first job after my doctoral program, and became so bad that I took a leave of absence to stay with friends and work on my mental health. I also knew I wasn't staying at this location long (it was a temporary job), and the constant moving and not having roots impacted me. I felt so lonely and empty.\n\nI tried many things during this time (TMS, Ketamine, Psilocybin) with varying impact. I had a brief relationship with a girl (26 when I was 32) that went very badly. When I got to where I am now for my latest job, I had been prescribed prozac, and a lot of these thoughts had subsided somewhat. I also realized from that last relationship that I had some interest in BDSM, and found that age gap relationships were more accepted there. This provided an avenue for me to explore these themes some, along with other aspects of BDSM I had never considered. I think that sexuality was/is so anxiety-riddled for me that I have never allowed myself to explore. For a summer I said \"fuck it\" and explored my sexuality-- this included random things like going to massage parlors for happy endings, traveling to Europe and having random sexual encounters with prostitutes, and just hooking up with people. No, I didn't have sex with any minors, and the only illegal thing I did was pay for sex.\n\nAround this time last year, I met my latest girlfriend, who was much younger than me (I am 35 now, she is 21), on Tinder. At first, I looked at it as another sexual fling, but we developed a relationship. I ended it for similar reasons as above, around doubting the fit of the relationship and feeling something was not right. We are still friends and care about each other a lot. During this time (once again), my thoughts around my sexuality and hands weren't there. Now that we have broken up, those thoughts have come back some.\n\nThat is my story to the best I can tell it in any sort of quick way. I am currently dating and realizing I am much less attracted to women my own age (35) than younger women (have it set on my phone for 21 to 30). I am not interested in dating anyone younger than 21 because of the anxiety that it produces within me, and the lack of fit that is usually there.\n\nI am concerned about my sexuality. I am really scared I will be alone for the rest of my life. I have never watched anything illegal, but gravitate towards the \"teen\" sections on Xvideos, as well as other taboo things (fucked up family, teacher) and more normal sections (redhead, asian, casting couch).\n\nThat being said, I find 15/16 year olds attractive all the time. Hell, I met a 13-year-old that I thought was cute and that filled me with a lot of dread. I obviously would never do anything at this stage of my life. I find 25/26 year olds just as attractive. It is really, really fucking hard to not be able to say this to anyone. So I am saying it here.\n\nI want to thank anyone who took the time to read this. Thank you and take care.",

I'm an overthinker, and overthinking is a severe problem of mine. It may be that there's the problem, and that theres no problem witih myself in particular, but I'm too busy overhinking that I could realise that.\n\nAs I was thinking after going to bed, I realised that there is no one besides my family who starts to talk with me without me starting the conversation, aside from people that want something specific from me. That feeling really sucks really hard... And I myself would not describe me as socally akward, but I'm an introvert and actively speaking to someone can really be a challenge. But that does not hold me off, no. I want to socialize and do that on as many occasions as possible, but people really do not seem to like starting a conversation with me. And I don't think of any deep talk or something like that, but even smalltalk like \"How is it going\"/... If I would not start a conversation with people I know, I feel like I could go a whole party without talking. Or any other event I'm visiting.\n\nOk, that's all I needed to get off my chest, but it was really needed.

I have put my career ambitions on hold to support us while she goes through the process as she only gets a stipend of a bit under $2k per month. I work as a PTA and last year I made $53,000. I know it\u2019s not the long-term career I want. We were fortunate enough to buy a house and I pay for 90% of associated expenses. Well, that girlfriend is now my fianc\u00e9e! We\u2019re getting married in a few months in Austin, Texas. \n\nI need to preface this next section by saying that I\u2019m a guarded, introvert and the type of person that requires several years before I consider someone a close friend. However, once I do consider someone a friend there\u2019s literally no limit to what I\u2019d sacrifice for them. My friends are dispersed across the country and even though my fianc\u00e9e and I are very financially constrained, I have made every effort to be at every single one of my friend\u2019s weddings at great personal cost. These haven\u2019t been run-of-the-mill weddings in the middle of nowhere, they\u2019ve been in some of the most expensive parts of the country and even a few international destination weddings.\n\nMy friends are all doing great. My lowest paid friend makes $180k with the highest paid making $1.1M last year. Most fall in the $200-$400k range. As my fianc\u00e9e and my RSVP book starts to fill up, several of my closest friends have declined. To add insult to injury, some of them live in the same damn city I\u2019m having my wedding. I went to high school in a very affluent area, but moved there from southwest houston at 13. My high school friends are genuinely good people and some of them are my best friends, but I\u2019ve always felt like a little bit of an outsider. Like our lives were similar but so different at the same time. My road towards success was full of obstacles atypical of a lot of my peers (family members with cancer, murders, arrests, death, addiction, anxiety, depression, etc.) \n\nI\u2019m trying to count my blessings, be thankful for my friends who will be there, appreciate the fact that I\u2019m marrying my best friend and love of my life, and understand that I\u2019m more fortunate than a great many people if not most people in the world. However, I still feel hurt to my core. I\u2019m tired of being overlooked and counted out. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e and my combined career uncertainty (she\u2019s getting her PhD in a healthcare field and RFK is a wrecking ball at the moment), a sense of betrayal, or depression as I reflect on a life of sacrifice for others who never reciprocated the effort. I used to have big dreams as a child. I\u2019m 34 and feel no closer to my dreams than when I was a child at Sharpstown mall in Houston watching ballers speed by in foreign cars. In the end I can only blame myself for never prioritizing myself. Over the years I\u2019ve realized the self-hate isn\u2019t productive tho.\n\nAt this point I plan on getting ungodly wealthy so I can bless every single person who\u2019s truly supported me. And then turn a cold shoulder and let everyone else know what they were overlooking.\n\nMoral of this cautionary tale: Be selfish. Fuck everybody, get money. Fuck everybody, relentlessly chase your wildest dreams.\n\n/end rant",

My exhaustion and breaking point reached such a level that I felt like my mental state was barely holding together. In a fleeting instant I felt the urge to kill him.\n\nI didn\u2019t. \n\nBut almost did. \n\nThe memory of that moment has persisted inside my mind for many years. I became a pastor. Started a ministry. They say I am strong and healed and that God works through me but they are unaware of the guilt I carry which therapy never uncovered. The spiritual presence haunting me remained beyond the reach of my prayers.\n\nSo I wrote a book. \n\nNot for fame. Not for pity. \n\nMy silence proved more deadly than any battlefield experience.\n\nA number of individuals believe that by sharing these details I overstepped certain boundaries.

    "title": "I have a fetish/kink I haven\u2019t told to anyone",
    "selftext": "So as the title says, I do have a fetish/kink that I HATE myself for having. I don\u2019t think I will specify what it is, but it isn\u2019t harmful and it\u2019s quite common actually. However, I HATE having it. Every time I use this to get off I try to distract myself immediately after. I\u2019ve only every told it to one person and that was my ex, which now makes me INCREDIBLY uncomfortable with, because I\u2019m paranoid they\u2019ll tell people. \n\nI do have some things to say/ask about it.\n\n1. I engage in this fetish by consuming online content. I do NOT interact with the community, or want to do this with a partner. I want to do what I\u2019ve always done, which is just get it over with. It\u2019s a really odd relationship that I have with it. My body reacts to this fetish, and part of my mind does too, but I\u2019d say me as a person, I think it\u2019s disgusting. I get annoyed when I need to get off to it.\n\n2. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s considered a kink or a fetish. I most definitely do not need to use it 24/7 when I\u2019m in the mood, but if I think about it too much or it just comes up, I can tell when it\u2019s time for me to start using this to get off. So sometimes it is something I need to use, but it isn\u2019t something I use every time. Can\u2019t tell if that means it\u2019s a fetish or a kink..\n\n3. Instead of how I usually get off, I need to use something inbetween my genitals and my hand. (For ex, don\u2019t use this but don\u2019t wanna get too specific: a pillow to hump or smth) Don\u2019t know why, I guess this method started as a kid? I\u2019m just unsure why it\u2019s COMPLETELY and ONLY connected to this fetish/kink. Like, when I\u2019m just normally horny I don\u2019t use this, I just use my hand-\n\n4. Can people get over fetishes? I\u2019m assuming not but it\u2019s also difficult for me to accept this. I\u2019ve had this fetish/kink for like, maybe 5+ years? Started when I was fairly young, I also just don\u2019t know why at all I have this fetish. When I search about why someone could have it, it seems like nobody really knows how it starts. \n\n5. Also, to add to the kink or fetish part, I also am not aroused when this fetish comes up in everyday life. Since it\u2019s a common fetish, it is a normal everyday sort of thing so when I experience it with friends or family, I just react normally. However on the INSIDE, depending on how the person reacts, I either don\u2019t think about it at all, or am absolutely disgusted by the person. WHICH IS STUPID because IM THE GROSS ONE. I\u2019m the one who knows it\u2019s connected to a fetish, I don\u2019t get aroused when it\u2019s happening but I DO feel grossed out and uncomfortable. Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re friends or family, and when they say or do things that I\u2019ve seen in sexual content for my fetish/kink, I feel awful and uncomfortable because\u2026they\u2019re my friends/family! I don\u2019t feel that way about them, and I don\u2019t want to lump them into this gross interest I have..\n\nThat\u2019s about it- kinda glad I was able to discuss it somewhat, even if I can\u2019t bare to say what it is.

It\u2019s been a difficult day for me today and it just seems like all of my friends have things going on in their personal lives (understandably) and it\u2019s absorbed them. I have one friend who works for a government agency who is constantly concerned about her job, again understandably, but it\u2019s all she can talk and think about for months. To where when I call, it\u2019s what she talks about every time and she\u2019ll tell me she doesn\u2019t have the mental energy to listen to my stuff because of her circumstances. It\u2019s just difficult for me to be going through my own problems and not having her to lean on but I also want to be understanding of her circumstances and her feelings. Then I have another friend who is new to motherhood with a six month old and that\u2019s a tribulation in itself from the adjustment to it being her first child and to the lack of sleep to the new day to day for her. Very similar in that she\u2019s absorbed in her newly changed life that when I call it\u2019s just become me soundly listening to her for an hour without getting two words in because after I called she realized she needed someone to talk to and then after an hour she\u2019s out of time and has to go take care of him. I have another friend who works night shifts so we are on different schedules so it\u2019s difficult for me to ever contact her because of the hours she works. It\u2019s really discouraging when nobody initiates and calls or comes and checks in on me but I\u2019m always checking in on them because I know they\u2019re going through difficult times. I\u2019m not seeking pity because I know everyone has problems in their lives - it\u2019d just be nice to be able to talk about them with girl friends. So not having them available is difficult and I don\u2019t know if I should say something about asking if they could initiate more or just continue on like this. To clarify, I have always been the initiator well before these circumstances in their lives so have I set an expectation to them that I should always initiate? Has anyone dealt with something similar before with friends and what did you do about it and how did it turn out? ",

    "selftext": "Currently 16M and been hiding my sadness from my family as I dont trust them.Growing up I was extremely happy until I was about 7 when my mom and stepdad started arguing every night.I would go and comfort my mother after every fight in the bathroom. My mother would always threaten to leave and forced tough decisions on a poor 7 year old. My stepdad couldnt take it and left, leaving everything for my mother. He would visit me about once a month and I was content with that, until he suddenly stopped, I hated him after that. I only realized later on my mom forced him out of my life, and I always thought of him as my real father but when I turned 9 I found out he wasnt my real father and that my real father is a drug addict. We were eventually kicked out of the home and went to stay with my grandparents. My mom started dating someone else,but 3 months into dating we found out he stole money so that ended quickly. Later on when I was around 11 she met someone else and he was really invested in the beginnning, that was until we moved in together that I saw the real him. He was a narcissist and quite asshole friends, then covid hit and I was forced to be next to him for months. Eventually we could go outside and I had sleepovers with my one friend at his house and during one of the sleepovers my mom got pregnant. Things were reasonably smooth for that period until about a year later we moved to a bigger house to accomodate my new brother and thats when things started for me as the fights were constant and my door was repeatedly removed and clothes were only washed once a month so I had to wear the same clothes to the point where my socks became crusty as I have hyperhidrosis. About a year later they broke up and we moved into a 1-bedroom condo my brother, me and my mother. That lasted about 2 weeks till they got back together and he visited frequently.A month later we moved back in together and that's when he was his worst by degrading me constanly, eventually I became so isolated that all I did was chill in my room all day never coming out, except to collect dinner and return to my room. I was also physically abused by being pinned against walls and one time had my head slammed against a car window,whilst my mother did nothing,their fighting was constant, about every 2 weeks for a week or sometimes longer. One time my mom tried to commit suicide but luckily failed as I found her unresponsive on the couch and nearly broke my neck running up the stairs trying to call my grandma.I found a note in her jacket and used her unconscious body to unlock her phone,My grandma arrived and we rushed her to the hospital, I have never stressed so much in my life. One other time I found her just lying outside on the floor unconcious,once again almost breaking my neck running to my phone in my room, my grandma arrived and we woke her up, she was taking heavy pills and drinking wine. She has been doing that for a few years now,almost a zombie at night. Last year her old friend returned back into her life and confessed his feelings and we moved in together as she decided to dump the other one. That lasted about 3 months until we found out she had been cheating on him the entire time with mr.Abuser and the fighting became nonstop as he was determined to sort things out between them as he genuinely loved her but she became too rough and he kicked her out and she moved back in with abuser and her life has been miserable since as she makes terrible life choices. I moved in with my grandparents refusing to return to a abusive household. Since then ( July 2024) she has tried numerous times to convince me to move back in with her but I refuse everytime. Since the year started she has talked less and less to me even though she works at my grandparents house, even though she says so many horrible things behind their back, they permit her to work here. Ever since we moved in with Mr.Abuser I have been becoming a bigger introvert with massive insecurities and everytime I try to work on myself I relapse and despise myself even more only putting on a facade as to not draw attention but at times it's difficult to keep things botteled up and sometimes I just cry in the shower and at night when I'm alone. I havent been able to make many friends due to my securities but I still have my childhood friend and he has helped me through sooo much but I still feel uselss whenever he isnt around to keep me distracted. Ever since he degraded me my grades have fallen drastically as I feel no motivation to do anything even without seeing him for a year now I still feel immense pain thinking about the past. I used to have suicidal thoughts when I was slightly younger but have given up on such thoughts. I was sent to a therapist but all they said is that I have ADHD. I dont know what to do and feel very scared sending this message as I dont give much info about myself but any tips will be appreciated, also feel free to ask questions if it doesnt make sense because its currently 2AM and my brain is gone",

I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty well put together, I work out and dress nice.\n\nMy coworker jokingly said to me today, \u201coh you have everything except a wife and kids\u201d. \n\nYes. You sir are right. I\u2019ve lost my the one, my other the one. At this point I have quite a bit of myself to rebuild emotionally. After a \u201crelationship\u201d I had last year that I entered secure of myself, I spiraled into an anxiety driven chase for a why from a ghost. Of course that just made me look desperate and had the opposite effect. At the end of the day I was begging for communication since talking to a brick wall can be fairly hard. Pun intended. \n\nI\u2019ve moved on, not in the healthiest way. \nAfter an intervention with a friend I\u2019ve opened my eyes and realized the cycle I\u2019ve continued since I first started dating. \nOne where I get the girl, I commit myself to them, they do me dirty and I end it. Instead of taking time to processing it or coping properly. I\u2019d just chase the next attractive girl regardless of red flags and just torture myself until I bring myself to breaking up with them. Thinking to myself I should\u2019ve left sooner instead of hoping.\n\nI believe after some reflection I would say I don\u2019t have many positive role models in my life (other than my friends) when it comes to love. My parents always showed me love is earned through accomplishments and providing selflessly. Unfortunately not much was earned as it wasn\u2019t really ever enough. \n\nDating history:\nWhen I started dating, looking back I wasn\u2019t the best picker. I had been cheated on by my first girlfriend with one of my friends at the time. When she found out I knew, she avoided me until I pretty much got the hint that we weren\u2019t together anymore. \nMy next girlfriend had a video of her cheating on me circulating through the school till I was the last person to find out\u2026 or at least that\u2019s how it felt. \nAfter that my girlfriend from high school in to college. Well, she was a good girl. We had our differences and we broke up, she\u2019s married to the guy that came after me. I wasn\u2019t mature enough at the time for what she wanted. \nThroughout college was more ghosts than Halloween town, emotionally draining or otherwise superficial connections. \nOnce graduating I was stuck in an isolating relationship throughout covid. Disguised as devoted love, I was trapped. I had to flee my house when we broke up. Literally. \nNot long after I met a girl through my family and we clicked. She was a bit too chill and didn\u2019t have much of a vision for what she wanted for the future. She left to become more independent, I didn\u2019t fight it. \nMade the mistake dating someone from work\u2026 twice. One made me into a paramour without my knowledge and the other wanted me to change\u2026 a lot. They\u2019re friends now. Everything I\u2019ve heard through the grapevine (since I work at a different location) helped me realize I dodged some serious bullets there. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThings that I\u2019ve taken away from all of this. \n-Im at where 5 of the last 5 women I\u2019ve gone out with have cheated, been a mistress or some other highly questionable act that I morally disagree with. \n-You cant fix anyone but yourself. \n-I understand it takes two to tango, I\u2019m not innocent by any means. I\u2019m trying to learn from my mistakes. \n-Chemistry is what I\u2019m looking for now, someone I can see as my best friend. \nUnfortunately I have chemistry with mostly people who are emotionally unavailable, avoidant and or already have a partner. \n-Finding someone who shares the same idea of a future. \n-I\u2019m the only single guy out of all of my friends. In turn I have limited exposure to meeting new single people. \n-It\u2019s been a tough go, I\u2019ve began to try and focus on me and I\u2019m unsure where to go from here.

    "selftext": "\n(Apologies for the grammar) I have been really getting to thinking about my life so far and im not sure how i want to proceed. I am 18 M almost 19 M in my first year of college and i am studying to be an mechanical engineer, a degree i choose because i think that is what aligns with my future which is unclear to me really. I am fortunate to have been raised fairly well off by my parents providing me food, shelter, money, and a car to get to school and back, and i have also been set along a strong path with my acceptance into an honors college with my classes paid and a bright academic future ahead of me, yet something feels yet incomplete inside of me or rather i feel indifferent towards my current lifestyle. \n\nI am no expert in anything nor am i a top performer in my school either, infact i feel as if I dont belong in my school because of my attitude. I have been completing my courses so far with good scores but I tend to procrastinate to the last minute on certain assingments or just dont complete them at all because i know it wont affect me much. And i feel no shame when i do which leaves me questioning where my passion or care truly lies. \n\nI have no issues socializing with others on campus and i feel rather good when i speak with others, yet my relationships with others feel still distant and artificial(feel like im putting the most effort into the relationship). I recently have been making myself more kind and appreciative of others in hopes that i would help me find me better sweeter people to connect with and a chance to start over any loose ends or interactions with a fresher more open personality yet i feel as if im not being to real. All my life i have been told that i am more \u201cmature\u201d than others my age (mainly because i socialize easier with people older than me than those my age) since i dont have and guilt or shame speaking about stuff that concerns me and speaking up for others when those wont. This has gotten me into trouble sometimes because of my sort of reckless conversational habits. I think its mainly me letting go of the care of my self image/regard and ego by just being me if that makes sense? Like i just dont care anymore and i worry if that is to much for me and i better not for my sake. \n\nI dont have any wish to self harm or to hurt myself or others for the record. I just dont want to continue this path of my life since it feel so bitter and pointless and im not sure if that is a normal feeling. And it feels so weird writing it down because something wants to keep pulling me back and suppress this feeling to mantain a facade of normality for others looking which i know has been there from the beginning. Feels like i have always known this but to worried of what will happen if i confront this void in my way.\n\n Just feels right to say it/write it and actually right what you really feel regardless of shame or whatever little strand your gripping on to avoid the pain of sharing and getting out of your chest that you know you really desire/need to share. \n\nOn a side note i have been picking up the guitar and it has been one of the best thing for me that feels like its rebllious and freeing. All i ever want to do is come home and when im down just play and it feeds my soul a feeling that i never can seem to get much anywhere else. Playing and listening to music is like and escape for me and its almost all i ever want to do since it keeps me focused on my feeling and relaxes my mind like a detox. And it feel almost rebelious since i know its distracting me from my college work but it gives me a feeling that tells me everything is gonna be alright. And that is the thing i cant wrap my head around. Why cant i just be content with my current life and just strive for it? Why does doing what seems \u201cwrong\u201d or wasting time feel so right like im getting back at someone or something. Hell this is taking away time from me studying for my finals yet i dont seem to care since it feels too compeling to write what i feel, what i am. \n\nAm i just to fucking delusional or exaggerating what is going on or just finally clicking into what has been going with my life. I guess my actual question is, what now? Do i just quit college and do what furfills me even if i end dirt poor or alone. Or should i just continue on like how its been and try to ignore the fact. I guess guidance and a conversation is what im after from those in a similar boat in life.",

    "selftext": "Every piece of my body and soul is touched and squeezed by grimy capitalistic patriarchal colonialist fingers. I want them off!!! I\u2019ve been abused as a kid, drugged, kidnapped, and raped as an adult. The jobs that are available to me that are not part of this system of slave and child labor do not offer the capacity for me to save money, get healthcare, or provide for a family, or even a stable lifestyle.\n\nWe are kidding ourselves to think we are so far removed from our warring, tribal ancestors, and we are worse than them now, at least they were forced to respect the land and animals. Since we\u2019ve invented tools that allow ourselves to rape our natural resources, we are pillaging our home too.\n\nIn the US we act all fucking civilized, meanwhile we have over a MILLION people imprisoned, a MILLION native people still living on reservations where their ancestors were sent after we fucking STOLE THEIR LAND AND KILLED THEIR RELATIVES.\n\nIt\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nEvery purchase or need is cloaked with additional advertisements, fees, subscriptions, or some other scam. Simply getting proper food or care items feels like a Herculean act of fending off either accidentally purchasing shit disguised as food or a scam disguised as a service. \n\nEverything made and for sale seems hanging on oil and the creation of endless trash. It feels like hardly anything is reusable, recyclable, or repairable and crafting things that are is becoming increasingly harder and harder to do as the products and tools also become lower quality.\n\nThe options to create and buy things locally are disappearing at an alarming rate. Other things that are disappearing at an alarming rate: small businesses, small farms, small newspapers, anything small at all for that matter! Bugs! Birds! Small houses! Why is everything built a fucking McMansion? Who is buying those ugly PsOS!? And more importantly, who THE FUCK is living in them!?!? It certainly seems like absolutely nobody when I drive around the towns near me.\n\nI mean\u2026 to be honest, I knew this was all coming, and I think anybody paying attention did as well. But part of me hoped that we could pay reparations to native people, and ancestors of slaves. I hoped we could close prisons. I hoped we could participate in nationwide atonement and healing. I hoped we could diversify our systems enough to create equality and respect. I hoped the slow food movement would gain momentum, I hoped we would divest in oil, and stop using insecticides. I hoped proper healthcare and birth control and education would curb population over growth. I hoped we would become tolerant and loving to all beings and wait it out in relative peace until our sun exploded. Maybe send a few hopeful souls off on a ship with some hydroponics and grow lights, looking for fellow aliens.\n\nI knew it would be painful and terrible things would happen, but I thought there would also be some hope for better things ahead. I thought we would keep taking steps in the right direction, choosing the next best thing. I didn\u2019t realize the elite still want blood, still want slaves, still want things to rape and conquer and claim as their own. More importantly, I didn\u2019t think the general population would subsidize it.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that the bad actors have smoke screened everything so well, making it very difficult for us to see the evil behind the companies we support. But I don\u2019t understand why we are simply not all refusing to buy into this shit. If it\u2019s directly funding one of these bad actors, delete it! Stop buying it. Stop using it. Stop supporting businesses that use it. Just. Stop. How are we this addicted to something? How are we so apathetic?\n\nIsn\u2019t there somebody out there writing the handbook for something better? What are my other options? Where are my role models? Where\u2019s my MLK, my Mother Teresa? We have Greta at least, thank the goddesses. But on this whole Earth, teeming with sweaty humans, where are our leaders? Where are our helpers? Why are they so hard to find in this spider web of global connectedness? Are we all so afraid of taking risks? Speaking up against a bully? Why does it feel so scary? Are they just that good at hiding our role models from us? \n",

When we talked, she was crying and apologizing for how she treated me after the breakup and how I didn't deserve any of it. I forgave her but told her how it really made me feel and she said she completely understands. We just talked casually as friends for the next few days and every time she says \u201cwe're not good at being exes\" and that she loves and misses me but right now we just need time apart. She also promised me that we will find our way back to each other. She also never took down photos of us on her wall and kept all of the gifts I got her and she told me she's never going to be ready to move on.\n\nWe have been dating for over 2 years and I know when she's being genuine and it really seemed like she was. I couldn't agree more because we're both 19 and in our first year of college. We just kept talking and updating each other on our lives and we decided to go back into no contact but reach out every couple of weeks.

For the longest time I have been at a place where it takes everything out of me to just keep going as i am, I'm just too drained to pursue anything to try to improve things or services that are supposed to \"help\" me, which is also an inappropriate expectation with me because my issues stem from a much greater situation of life position that I just cant undo through mental health services. Somehow, my life situation would have to drastically improve from outside forces, so I've been just desperately hoping for the last possible path for that to happen to come through but my last remnants of dying fools hope is reaching its expiry. I'm just trying to hold on as long as I can now, just in case, but I've already delayed for various reasons and I'm pretty sure I don't have much longer as that hope really is all but dead and when it truly is then so will i.

i don\u2019t talk about this to anyone. i can\u2019t i\u2019ve never even let myself say it out loud, no one knows, maybe coz i thought i could get over it but yeah no, i cant stop, and it hurts so much, we're not exactly coworkers, shes my boss's boss, we're on the same office floor and shes the most beautiful person ive ever seen, when she turns around to look at you it genuinly feels like time stops and i'll tell you why,\n\nshe\u2019s indian and she wears these stunning sarees to work. before her i\u2019d never even seen one in real life now i catch myself noticing the details the embroidery the fabrics the way the pleats shift when she moves. everyone in the office compliments her on them but me i just stare like an idiot pretending i\u2019m not completely in awe of her. they suit her so well regal powerful untouchable.\n\nbut it's not just the sarees. it's her. her face is just... god. she\u2019s so beautiful. the kind of beautiful that doesn\u2019t even feel real, ive never seen anyone so alluring, so perfect. her eyes are dark and deep like there\u2019s a whole world behind them no one else can touch IK its so corny but you havent seen her. her hair is so beautiful, its pitch black and on the days she wears it open, my heart flies out my chest when i see her. her smile knocks the air out of my lungs. and the way she moves\u2014 it sounds weird but she genuinely always walks like shes on the runway, its something my collegues have mentioned too, like she owns every space she walks into, like she was born to be admired. she doesn\u2019t try to be beautiful. she just is. and it ruins me.   \nthe way she walks the way she speaks. she never has to raise her voice never has to demand respect she just gets it, shes so confident, she\u2019s sharp driven one of those people who seem like they were born to lead. i look at her and think god i want to be like that but more than that i just want to be around her but even more than that i SO wish she was mine, ugh i even hate saying something like that but you would know if you saw her.\n\ni think what really broke me was diwali. she hosted a party at her house and i dont even know how i was invited but i went. i shouldn\u2019t have, but i did. her home was warm beautiful filled with so much life. her husband charismatic kind the kind of man you just know is good. her kids were so lovely, that day she told us she was wearing the same lehenga she wore in one of her wedding ceremonies, and i honestly can not put into words how stunning she looked it almost brought tears to my eyes im not even lying, she was adorned with jewelery her eyes looked oh so beautiful and her smile is something that never fails to melt me. jesus.  \n  \nshe made all of us feel so welcomed and the food was so amazing but obviously by the end of it i was so crushed, i realised how royally fucked i am, i cant be falling so hard for someone that would never in a thousand years want me like that,\u00a0that should\u2019ve been my wake-up call. it should\u2019ve made me move on. instead it made me wish god it made me wish so damn hard that it had been me. that she had met me first. that i was the one she fell in love with back in grad school the one she built this life with. and i know how pathetic that sounds and i know how impossible it is i know how unrealistic and childish it is i\u2019m too old for fantasies like this but i can\u2019t stop. i can\u2019t fucking stop.  \n  \nthis isn\u2019t some dumb little crush it\u2019s been a year a whole fucking year of feeling like this and i thought maybe it would fade but it\u2019s only gotten worse, ofcourse i don\u2019t want an affair. i don\u2019t want to ruin her life her happiness her family. i just want to exist in a world where maybe just maybe she could have been mine. that in some other time some other place i was the one she looked at like that. the one she built her life with. it\u2019s stupid and selfish and impossible but god i wish it so bad it makes my chest ache. its so pathetic. she only thinks of me as a junior, shes always kind in the few convos we'd had, absoultely no indication of liking me and why would there be, shes a respectable woman with a hot successful husband and im literally 26 wow typing it out i see how stupid this is i really need to suck it up and stop acting as if ive never seen a woman before but writing it out is so cathartic\n\ni\u2019ve tried switching teams didn\u2019t work, no opening now i\u2019m actually considering switching jobs because i don\u2019t know how to deal with this anymore. i feel like i\u2019m stuck in this endless loop and the only way out might be to just leave. maybe this is something i just need to get over maybe i\u2019m being dramatic maybe in a few months i\u2019ll read this back and cringe at how ridiculous i sound.\n\nbut right now right now all i can think about is how much i wish i could turn back time and rewrite everything.",

My dad died after 12 years with cancer in 2023. I am terrified. I already have adrenal insufficiency due to a congenital condition and while I know there is no point in getting ahead of things, I'm also fearful that this complexity would make treatment for cancer (or even some sort of autoimmune condition) difficult. I have not had great endocrinologists in the past.\n\nI am 34 years old. I am supposed to be defending my PhD dissertation proposal at the end of this month and starting data collection in May. I am autistic and have frankly worked worked really hard to get this far (with a lot of help and luck and other privileges, of course). My dad made me promise I wouldn't let his death derail my education. I believe my research is important and I want to be able to continue helping children by doing it.

Usually I am more resilient, but this is pushing me to the edge of my endurance.\n\nThank you for listening to this post.

    "selftext": "It was a warmer day the other day in Ohio, perfect for escaping the constant rush of daily life. I had a book in hand, and I decided to head to the park to lose myself in the pages. The bench under the large tree felt like the ideal spot to relax and unwind. I settled in, opening my book and letting the world fade around me.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I noticed someone approaching. An older man, probably in his sixties, with a kind face. He sat on the bench beside me, glancing at the book I was reading with mild curiosity.\n\n\"Is that a good one?\" he asked, his voice soft, almost tentative.\n\nI looked up and smiled. \"It is, actually. It's one of those stories that pulls you in slowly.\"\n\nWe began chatting about the book, then about other things\u2014life, memories, the small joys that only come with time. His stories were charming, filled with humor and a sense of nostalgia. I found myself laughing more than I had in days. Time seemed to slip by unnoticed.\n\nAt some point, our conversation paused, and there was a strange silence that lingered. He turned towards me, his eyes steady but kind, almost as if he was weighing something in the air between us. The warmth of the afternoon sun seemed to glow a little brighter as I realized that, for reasons I couldn't explain, I was no longer just thinking about the conversation, but about the space that had quietly grown smaller between us.\n\nAnd then, without thinking, without warning, he leaned in\u2014just a little, just enough to close the distance between us. Before I knew it, his hand was on my upper thigh. He asked me if this was okay. I couldn\u2019t get a word out but shook my head yes. He slowly moved his hand higher and higher. Since I was not moving a muscle, he said just relax. He moved his hand from my groin area to my ass. I had never had anyone touch my ass before and kinda liked it. I was looking back at his hand touching me and when I looked forward he was stroking his cock. I had never seen anyone else stroking before. He asked if it was ok. I had a similar response as before and shook my head. Within two minutes, he was squeezing my ass real tight, making some faces, and I knew he was getting close. Out of nowhere, I grabbed his balls and cock and finished him off. His load shot everywhere. It made me happy to help him finish.\n\nWe pulled back slowly, and I was left with a sense of surprise, and oddly, calm. The man smiled, a little embarrassed, but not in a way that made me uncomfortable.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he murmured, but his eyes told me there was no regret.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything at first. I simply looked at him, trying to figure out the strange feeling in my chest. But then I realized something: I wasn't angry, or startled, or upset. Instead, I felt a strange warmth that felt more like an unspoken understanding.\n\n\"You know,\" I said finally, \"I wasn't expecting that.\"\n\nHe chuckled softly. \"Life can surprise you sometimes.\"",

That was pain. Few months later she confessed to me that she had crush on me during university. But we are still friends, not close as before but check on each other regularly.\n\nToday, I was searching for a picture, so I opened my older photos. Well, most of my old photos are with her, lots of funny videos, great and awesome memories, a lot of smiles and tears. Its been 3 years since she rejected me, I thought I moved on, but it seems no, I still like her and miss her, she is an amazing girl, she is engaged right now and getting married soon, but I wish things were different. She was the only person that really cared about me, spent hours, days, nights with me, she is the one that really knows me. I will be in her wedding after three months, she will see me happy and smiling but deep down I think I will be in pain.\n\nGood luck L in your life, have an amazing one \u2764\ufe0f",

    "selftext": "Mandatory : this happened in january but I am just now sharing with anyone other than my bank and the police.\n\nSo I (21M) moved to France at the start of this year, and things started off badly, with me falling for a rental scam.\n\nEssentially I responded to an ad on a rental website (seloger) for a studio rental for 1000\u20ac. \n\nI got an email the day after, where the scammer showed me photos of the studio. We started talking via whatsapp, and the person asked me for my ID, which initially seemed normal. She would then send a copy of her own ID (now it's obvious she stole someone else's), and scheduled a visit for when I arrived in France. \n\nHere is where it went south, she started by asking to pay the 1st months rent (1K) upfront as a standard part of the process and she sent me a (make believe) rental contract for me to sign and send. The contract seemed legitimate so I went along. After a while, I asked her to send proof of ownership, to which she sent a property tax statement. After a while, she asked for a caution of two months rent which, again, was in the contract. I told her I would rather pay when we met but she claimed it was needed before as international rental laws were different. I stupidly went along with it.\n\nNeedless to say, on the day of the visit, no one showed up, I stood 3 hours outside the building. I then recieved an email from the rental website saying the ad I responded to was suspected of fraud.\n\nI immediately filed a police report and reported everything to Revolut. Revolut wasn\u2019t able to retrieve the money I wired and I still have no answer from the police (I'm not hopeful for one tbh). Also made a new passport at the embassy so that the one I showed was voided\n\nI stayed in a hostel for a couple nights and then I managed to rent a room in a shared flat where I still am\n\nTL;DR: \"Rented\" a property that didn't exist in real life, lost 3000 euros; and shared a photo of my old passport for good measure.",

This was my first relationship and the only time I have ever been in love with a person in that sense. \n\nIt took me a while to get over the break up but a few months later I was seeing a guy that I thought I liked. Fast forward two months of seeing him and I get SO bored. I get irritated that he\u2019s not making plans and actively trying to see me (I do also like 98% I\u2019m lesbian but still not one hundred percent). In the end, he ghosts me and I don\u2019t really give a shit tbh like everybody was feeling bad for me and I couldn\u2019t even pretend to be upset. \n\nJust over a month later, I begin seeing this girl. We move really fast and start actually going out towards the beginning of December. She meets all my friends, my family, she even comes out to her parents and comes on a weekend trip with me and my friends. Fast forward to after the trip with my friends, beginning of February and I am not happy. I realised that maybe I didn\u2019t actually like this girl as much as I thought. I start comparing how I\u2019m feeling towards her to how I was feeling about my ex at that point in our relationship. \n\nI broke with her as soon as I realised this was how I felt and that this relationship wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere (this was about 2 months ago maybe less). Since the breakup I\u2019ve just been thinking about how much of it I compared to my first relationship. Everything we did.\n\nShe cuddled me one way, I thought about how much I preferred my exes. \nShe didn\u2019t like something, I thought about how much my ex would love it.\nI referenced a pop culture moment / meme and she didn\u2019t get it, I thought about how my ex would. \nI was watching sports game on the tv, I thought about how much I would love to be watching with my exes family.\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy situation because my ex and I share most of the same friends and us getting together was one thing but the break up holy shit. Changed the dynamic of everything. After a year, we\u2019ve gotten to a point where we can hang out in the same company (nothing bad ever happened between us and there was never any bad blood. I just needed the space and I knew that hanging out in the same company and knowing everything about their life would fuck with my help and not help me get over her). I don\u2019t want to fuck that up \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Im planning to move a few hours away in about 7/8 months and I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll never be able to stop thinking about her even when I leave. I don\u2019t want to fuck everything by saying how I\u2019ve been feeling especially when I don\u2019t even know if I am still in love with her or I\u2019m in love with the idea of loving someone that much again???\n\nThis has been weighing on me because I can\u2019t tell many people that wouldn\u2019t be freaked when it\u2019s their friend too \n\n",

    "selftext": "So, I (F) used to be a loud person\u2014I loved partying, smoking, and making all kinds of jokes. My friends and I would get drunk, laugh loudly, and just do typical drunk-people things. I had a close guy friend, let\u2019s call him **ABC**, who got into a relationship with this girl, **DEF**. She always seemed a bit judgmental towards me, but things really escalated after they started dating. However, **DEF** and **ABC** openly French kiss all the time\u2014she pulls his shirt toward her, and they engage in intense makeout sessions (minus actually groping each other\u2019s private parts). **ABC** even buries his face in her boobs in public. Yet, every time we hang out, **ABC** being loud\u2014whether with or without **DEF**'s friends\u2014is perfectly fine. But when it\u2019s me, suddenly it\u2019s a problem.\n\nAt first, she just distanced herself, which is fine\u2014I get that not everyone vibes with each other. But then she started reporting us to authorities over the smallest things, like being loud at parties, without ever just *talking* to us. She made sure all her friends cut me off too, even ones I was really close with. And the kicker? She\u2019d invite *everyone* from my friend group and inner circle to hang out but *exclude* me.\n\nThen there\u2019s her best friend, **XYZ**. We both liked the same guy at one point, and I opened up to her about him but then she\u2019d make passive-aggressive comments about me checking him out, and i caught her *literally* putting his face into her boobs when he was drunk. If she really liked him so much she could've just spoken to me but then going behind my back and cooking so much of a mess is crass. I also saw her take him away when I was trying to talk to him. Later, she had a serious incident where a guy groped her while drunk. At first, we all supported her, but she kept bringing it up over and over, turning it into some *soap opera* moment where she\u2019d pull the guys aside one by one to talk about it every time we hung out. Eventually, we felt like she was exaggerating and using the situation for attention, and *that* was apparently the moment we were \u201cout of our moral senses.\u201d So **DEF, ABC,** and their whole crew iced us out.\n\nFast forward\u2014**DEF**, who was supposedly so sensitive about **XYZ**\u2019s trauma, ended up moving out to a new flat and *completely* ditching **XYZ** to find random roommates by herself. Now, **DEF** and **ABC**\u2019s group has also started excluding **XYZ**. So much for moral loyalty, right?\n\nAs for **ABC**, he was a good friend to me for a while\u2014he even helped me through a breakup behind **DEF**\u2019s back.\n\nI cut my losses, moved on, and found new friends. Fast forward\u00a0two years, and I haven\u2019t spoken to them in forever. Then, out of nowhere, she smirks at me the other day. Like??? Girl, what is your problem? You got your little friend group, my ex-friend chose you, and you\u00a0still\u00a0feel the need to be petty?\n\nThat smirk got to me, I won\u2019t lie. So I texted my ex-friend about it.\n\nBut the second I called **DEF** a \u201cwholesome wannabe\u201d after she smirked at me (when I wasn\u2019t even speaking to her), he went off, verbally abused me, and told me to *always* speak about her with respect because he cares about her more than anything. It became clear he craves her validation\u2014he\u2019s not the most conventionally attractive guy, and **DEF** gives him social clout.\n\nThe whole situation feels fake and petty. I get it\u2014people change, and friendships evolve, but this just feels orchestrated. And the worst part? The people who cut me off for being \u201cout of my moral senses\u201d are now doing the exact same thing to **XYZ**.\n\nWhat do you think? Was I actually in the wrong, or was this just a bunch of people being performative for social status?",

    "selftext": "First and foremost, I am making this post as a way to finally get everything related to this incident off my chest and out in the open. This is a long-winded post.\n\nI have been to various therapists and counselors. I have found some closure in some aspects, but there is nothing that can be said by anyone in this whole world that would make me change my mind that this was all my fault, and I have come to terms with that.\n\nI would appreciate no comments \"reaffirming\" that I'm not to blame, I have already heard it and all variations. As nice as it may be, that's not what I want or why I'm typing this all out at 4am. I can't sleep and I can't stop thinking about my dad, and this is the only place I know to put this.\n\nTW: Abandonment, descriptions of death\n\nOn to the story.\n\nIn 2002, after over a decade of marriage, my mother left my father to be with a man she had met on the internet. At the time, this was considered massively abnormal, as the internet was still not in every household and online stranger danger stuff from the late 90s was still in full swing.\n\nI was still 12 at the time. On the day my mother was leaving I woke up just in time to see her heading out the door. She acted weird and said she would see me later, and not to open the note she had left for my dad for when he came home from work.\n\n6 hours later, my father comes home and asks where mom is. I shrug and tell him she left a note. After leaving to read the note in his bedroom for about an hour, he comes out and just says \"She left us.\"\n\nDuring the very brief time after my mother left and when my father eventually passed, which was just a few months, he ended up dating a rebound \"friend\" who I later in life found out was also an old drug buddy. I hated her, saw red flags, but I was a friendly kid, and not knowing that she was a junkie, just wanted to see my dad happy and encouraged them being together.\n\nI turned 13 that April and celebrated my birthday with my dad. He died less than a month later, on Mother's Day, from a drug overdose that I truly feel like I could have prevented or rectified, whether at the time or by simply voicing my concerns over his girlfriend.\n\nDuring the days and weeks leading up to his death, he would regularly fall asleep at inappropriate times. Sometimes even while driving and I would have to grab the steering wheel and correct the car while waking him. He was a single dad, working as a mechanic, I just thought he was tired and stressed out from everything that was going on.\n\nOn the day of his death, he spent his day at his girlfriends house and I was at our home, which was about 45 minutes away from town and out in the backroads of a southern state. He arrived home pretty late, but brought me pizza for supper.\n\nI don't know why but that night I did give him an extra hug and told him how much I loved him. He fell asleep in his favourite recliner.\n\nHis girlfriend called me that night after he had fallen asleep and told me that he was \"acting funny\" and to just \"please make sure his chest keeps rising and falling\".\n\nI believe my father got home around 8pm, and the call must have come between 9-11pm. I stayed up all night watching my father while I was playing video games. At one point he started breathing weird, but it sounded like he was just having a nightmare or bad snoring episode. He would snore so loud it would rattle the windows sometimes, it didn't seem too unusual.\n\nI didn't figure this out for many years, but all those sounds I heard were him dying. I was sitting there listening to my dad die and I had no idea. And all I fucking did was play stupid fucking video games.\n\nI eventually took a nap at 6 am and woke up at 8 am. I went to him and talked to him to wake him up and he didn't respond. My dad was a bit of a prankster, so I thought he was gonna try to pretend to be super asleep then try to scare me by jumping at me, he did it regularly. Then I saw how pale he looked, saw the snot in his mustache, so I reached out to shake him and say \"dad, I think you sneezed...\" but he was cold.\n\nMy father died in the two hours I decided not to watch him.\n\nI had no idea what to do. I called the only person I could think of... my best friend. Who then took on the task of telling my mother for me while I called the police.\n\nAmongst the police and others, his girlfriend showed up wailing with sorrow to witness the scene and I watched her steal my father's money out of his wallet, right beside his dead body.\n\nI spent the next year being tossed from godparent to grandparent to aunt to whoever didn't consider me as a burden at the moment, while eventually settling back at my home with my older half-sister who was appointed as my guardian.\n\nWhile my father's family was forcing me to couch surf, I would only find out 3 nonths after my father's passing that they were really getting into my home, stealing property left to me as inheritance, selling it, and got away with all of it. Tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of goods and vehicles.\n\nThe question here is always \"how? That's not legal\". Well, I don't know. All I know is it wasn't me, half-sister, dad, or mom who sold those things.\n\nMy older half-sister finally came to take care of me, she lived in another state. We tried to save the house, my childhood home, but unbeknownst to anyone but herself, my mother had actually double mortgaged the house. No one could keep up with the payments.\n\nOn moving day, my dad's father was still stealing my things off my UHaul while we were trying to pack and leave. My dad's family literally never stopped stealing from me until I was out of that state.\n\nAfter about a year of trying and failing miserably to save the house, my sister shipped me off to another country, while she went back to her normal life. His family didn't blame, abandon, disown, or steal from her. Quite the opposite in fact. They would dote on her, keep in touch, and even add her to social medias in the following years while avoiding me and pretending I was never born.\n\nEveryone left me to rot.\n\nOut of sight, out of mind. Even my half-sister barely talked to me, and we stopped talking for 6 years.\n\nMy mother couldn't have left my father for just anyone, either. It was a scumbag, who lived in another country, who had a fetish for stepdaughter pr0n. His story is for another day or maybe never.\n\nWhat ensued were 20 years of almost nothing but poverty-stricken misery in total isolation with no one but my mother and sicko step father, with some sporadic good times thrown in.\n\nWe were middle class in the 90s. I went from a normal life to literal hellholes that I barely escaped from without un@l1vering myself. \n\nI lost my dad. I lost all of my pets (rehomed). I lost all of my friends (no social media at that time and LD calling was expensive). I lost my childhood home and most of my personal items. I lost my inheritance to family theft. I lost my entire life.\n\nWithout undermining anyone elses loss and said with all due respect, when most people lose a parent, they lose a parent. I had the pain of losing not only that, but everything in a devastating domino effect of my stupidity, kind-heartedness, and ignorance.\n\nAnd no one has ever acknowledged this to me. Not my half-sister. Not my mom. No one. The absence of acknowledgement of the years and ways I've suffered for this has been... inhumane. I still don't understand what was so wrong with me, that they never wanted anything to do with me.\n\nI eventually crawled my way out from that. In 2023 I saved up for a down-payment on a home and moved 20 hours away from everything and everyone that was making me miserable.\n\nI got a dream job this past year to boot.\n\nI'm also with a wonderful woman that I plan to marry next year. I never would have met her if I never moved. When I still lay awake on nights like tonight, crying for my father, she's there for me. She understands me so well, and takes care of this ripped and fragmented part of myself. I'm so lucky to have her.\n\nBut no matter what I achieve, I still find myself falling back to... this. Shattered. I loved my daddy so much, and the hurt and pain will never go away.\n\nTime does not heal all wounds. We just learn how to deal with them. Sometimes dealing with them is crying for hours at 4 am while your lover sleeps beside you as you're writing a post that no one will read.\n\nIf you made it this far, I appreciate it. This really helped, to tell the story in most of its fullness. I guess I don't mind an AMA if anyone has anything.\n\nI hope I can sleep now. Goodnight.",

My mind is slow, my energy is low, my motivation is on the floor. I\u2019m just patiently waiting for this period to pass and try not to indulge in any nasty habits. I would say that most of my energy currently goes here, just not in sliding back in to shit lol.\n\nI was reflecting about it these days that I\u2019m actually in a quite good situation compared to most people, at least in terms of my habits: i do not smoke, do not drink, go jogging daily, do not use instagram or god forbid that devilish brain melting tik tok thing. I mean compared to people who just sit on tik tok all day I\u2019m like a super hero lmao and this kind of thought cheers me up in these moments of depression lmao. I say to myself \u201cChill on Patrick, as long as you do not get in to those habits you\u2019re good to go, you just need to be patient, endure this low period and as soon as you will come out of that fog you\u2019ll be back on track 10 time stronger then now\u201d. Yeah I believe that this is the main thought that is giving me the energy to keep it on and persevere.\n\nI feel like the lack of sociality and my tendency for self isolation is getting quite a problem some times. Today I was thinking that this problem is like a snake that is eating itself. From one side when I\u2019m depressed, burned out or whatever the hell I\u2019m having currently that is making me feel this way, I also tend to self-isolate way more then my usual (which is already a lot so you can imagine the tragedy lol ) and I feel like the more I self isolate the more I get depressed but the more I can depressed the more I self isolate, so you get where it goes lol. So today I was thinking that perhaps I should push myself to interact a little more and to reach out to people so that I can maybe create a little bit of an uplifting spiral. At the same time damn man my self isolating part is so strong, like some times I really don\u2019t want to see anyone and be alone but at the same time I want somebody to love me and to care about me lol , guess that\u2019s not gonna happen If I\u2019m not reaching out to anyone xD. Well perhaps it is something I will start doing for myself, the loving and caring thing, which in a way I\u2019m already doing by writing this journal entry.",

    "selftext": "I'm a 40+ year old man, married for 13 years with two kids.\n\nWhen I was about 13, we went to visit my uncle and his family. My aunt has two daughters from a previous marriage; one is about 8 years my senior and the other is a few months my junior. This story is about my slightly younger step-cousin.\n\nOne night while I was sleeping peacefully, I woke up to my cousin walking into the living room. We never got along particularly well so I pretended to stay asleep with the hope that she'd just go away. Instead, she proceeded to walk over to me and lay directly on top of me. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to freak out and risk waking anyone else up so I continued to pretend to be asleep.\n\nAfter a minute or two, she started wiggling her hips around, and I could feel myself getting an erection. I'm pretty sure that was her intention because once she noticed she started grinding on me. The next thing I knew, she took my hands and put them directly on her ass. I kept my eyes closed as tight as I could and tried to focus my thoughts on my dead dog. I honestly don't remember what happened after that, only that eventually I must have fallen asleep because I woke up by myself on the couch.\n\nI never told my parents about it because I didn't know how they would react. I told my wife about it once but she kind of blew it off and I've never spoken to anyone else about it since. Thankfully I didn't have to see her again for at least 10 years, maybe more. But I can't help but wonder how this has impacted me. Sometimes the memory will randomly pop into my head and I feel ashamed about the whole situation. \n\nWhen I was 18 and a freshman in college, I lost my virginity to a girl who was not a virgin (she actually lied to me about how many people she had slept with by a multiple of 2). Initially I told her no, I wasn't ready but then she started to cry and say that I think she's a w***e until I gave in. When my wife and I started dating in our mid 20s, we were making out but hadn't even seen each other naked yet. We went into her bedroom and I assumed we were going to start slow. Instead, as soon as I got naked she pushed me onto the bed and mounted me. I wasn't necessarily opposed, but I did have some conflicting feelings.\n\nAll these years later I wonder how connected my handling of these events are to the incident with my cousin. What do Redditors think? Either way, I'm relieved to finally get this off my chest after 30 years.",

There was always this weird passive aggression in the air, little comments, side eyes, inside jokes I wasn\u2019t part of. And sometimes I would be the joke. At first, I tried to ignore it and told myself I was just overthinking, but the feeling stuck. They\u2019d leave me out of plans, post about it, and then act like nothing happened. I got tired of pretending I was okay with being treated like an afterthought. So I distanced myself. But now that I\u2019ve stepped away, I feel kind of lost. I don\u2019t really have anyone close at school right now. I keep hoping I\u2019ll find my people, but it\u2019s been hard.

    "selftext": "Hello friends!\n\nIt's that time of the year again. We have always intended for\u00a0r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.\n\nPolitical anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:\n\n**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.\n\n**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:\n\n[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)\n\n[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)\n\n[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)\n\n**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.\n\n**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.\n\n**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a**\u00a0[list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/)\u00a0**on our sidebar as well as a link to a**\u00a0[global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)\u00a0**of emergency numbers.**\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions feel free to make a comment in this thread, or\u00a0[send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Fmentalhealth)\n\nStay safe out there!",

    "selftext": "Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.\n\n# What do the mods do?\n\nModerators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.\n\n# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?\n\nIf you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.\n\nIf this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)\n\n# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?\n\nMod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.\n\n# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?\n\nYes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.\n\nOur team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.\n\nIf you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.\n\nNo one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.\n\nSecond, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).\n\n# How do I apply?\n\nIf you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:\n\n1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:\n   * What does mental health mean to you?\n   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?\n   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?\n2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.\n3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.\n4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.\n\nThanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",

I have been under an immense amount of stress. I'm actively losing my perfect little life. Its my fault. I'm newly sober. I've been seeing a shrink, I'm medicated. I have a lot of suicidal ideation but that isn't really new. I don't have the means to pay for any treatment. All that said...\n\nI'm like seeing things. I'm having really vivid hallucinations and time dilation. Way more intense than when I was on actively using drugs. I hear voices. I see people. I talk to people that aren't there,  I've lost time.

I'm having a hard time discerning what is reality and what I'm dreaming. I feel like I never rest. I can't stop the chatter of voices. I hear muffled music coming from the sink and the fan. Last night my oldest childhood friend knocked on my window and I let him in and we talked for hours about our kids and stuff from our childhood. He kept handing me things. Photographs, books, drugs, money, little knick nacks and they would just fall through my hands. We walked to the park and it was on fire and I put the fire out and was offered a job and then went home. I woke up in the morning and went for a walk to the same park. It was fine. There was never any fire. I knew that fire happened the way I know grass is green. Just a self evident truth. And this is just the most recent thing in a trend that's lasted since getting sober. I miss my family so much. I don't have words for it. My wife is perfect. My baby boy is perfect. My other three kids are teenagers and have their problems but I love them and want to be there for them but I don't even fucking know what's real right now. I'm scared. I'm really scared. I don't know if I've ever been afraid before, not really. I don't even know if I'm writing this right now or if I'm going to wake up tomorrow and this is just another thing I hallucinated.

I was supposed to be 2 years clean from self harm in October, but I ended up relapsing in September. I'm probably about a month clean now, but my prom is April 29th. \n\nI've always self harmed in places I know I can hide it. My upper arms taking most of it. My dumbass thought my scars would be faded in time for prom. But they kind of aren't. They are still very noticeable. No one knows that I've relapsed and I really want to spend my prom shame free. I don't want anyone to know. Im worried that if my girlfriend found out she'd relapse herself. I've lied to my parents these past 6 months and told them I haven't relapsed. I don't want people around me to see me for the scars on my arms. The looks I got last time I wore a tank top in front of classmates made me feel so disgusting. I just don't want it to define my night. \n\nUnfortunately I fell in love with a dress that is spaghetti strap. I wanted to find something that would cover the scars, but I couldn't find one. So I'm wondering if anyone here knows of any cute clothing items that could cover upper arm scars that would fit with a prom style dress? The theme is \"a night in Paris\" and my dress is cream with a pastel pink and green Floral pattern. If that helps with ideas at all. \n\nAlternatively, does anyone know how to cover scars with makeup? If you have any recommendations or tips or tutorials that would be wonderful. Despite being an 18 year old girl I've never actually worn makeup other than a little bit of eyeshadow, a little bit of eyeliner, or a little bit of mascara lol. So using makeup seems really daunting, but any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!!! ",

    "selftext": "So my brother (21) has started dating this girl (18) who went to the same secondary school as me. Her entire friend group would bully me the entire time I was there, nothing physical other than like drawing on my books or putting water on my bag. She was never one of the main ones who said/did anything but she happily stood and laughed at my expense. \n\nThis really affected me at the time. I was depressed in secondary school and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder so they put me in support groups but that gave the group of girls more things to pick on. And honestly seeing/talking to any of these girls now brings me right back to that place mentally. \n\nShe\u2019s been nice to me since they got together but we went to the same college and she was not particularly the nicest to me then either so I know she\u2019s only being polite to make my brother happy. \nShe likes to claim to my mum and my brother that she looked out for me in secondary school because our brothers were best mates so she knew who I was. That\u2019s a straight up lie. I\u2019ve told my mum about all of this + she remembers from when it was happening but I don\u2019t really want to rock the boat by calling my brothers gf out on all of this. \n\nHonestly what makes this worse is I\u2019m currently going through a lot mentally rn without this on top. When I see her or hear her speak I go right back into that anxious state I was in back then. And she\u2019s here almost every day since she lives pretty close (5 mins walk ish) \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s taking such a toll on me mentally. It\u2019s already hard for me to leave my room without her in the house but when she\u2019s here it\u2019s an impossible task. But my brother is so happy with her and they do seem to be good for each other. Maybe i need to get over it and hope that she\u2019s changed but I just cant fully believe that she has. ",

    "selftext": "I need brutal honesty and advice. I\u2019m a compulsive liar, and no matter how hard I try, I keep fabricating insane lies about myself. It\u2019s gotten so bad that people genuinely believe a completely fake version of me, and I\u2019m terrified of being exposed.  \n\nSome examples of my lies:\n\nFake heritage: A lot of people genuinely think I\u2019m half Afro-Cuban (I even learned Cuban dances/recipes to sell it). In reality, I\u2019m 100% white European. I just think my real background is \"boring.\"  \n\nFake mental health severity: I do have autism and ADHD, but I exaggerate both of them\u2014acting more severely autistic and scatterbrained than I really am for sympathy/attention. It\u2019s kind of the opposite of masking I suppose.\n\nFake trauma: I tell people my dad abused me \"a lot\" as a kid. The truth is that he yelled often and called me worthless and stuff like that but he only hit me twice\u2014still bad, but not the extreme picture I paint with being hit daily and neglected.\n\nFake talents/intelligence: I claim to be a musical prodigy who \"turned down a record deal,\" and claim that if I would have accepted the record deal I would be famous by now but I can barely play an instrument. I also exaggerate my IQ when I\u2019m probably just average.  \n\nFake romantic and friendship history: I tell people girls constantly approach me and that I\u2019ve had exes. Truth? I\u2019ve never been approached, I\u2019m so childish and afraid of women that it probably wouldn\u2019t happen anyway, and I\u2019ve never even had a relationship, been on a date or even flirted before. I also claim that I have more friends than I really do.\n\nFake locations: I say I was born and raised in Louisiana (even though I\u2019ve never even been there) and pretend I\u2019ve traveled to countries I\u2019ve never visited.  \n\nWhy I do this:\nI think it\u2019s a mix of: Insecurity, Boredom, Attention-seeking, and maybe even impulse  control issues.\n\nBut now the lies are piling up, and I\u2019m stuck in a persona I can\u2019t maintain. The guilt is eating me alive and I honestly feel extremely worthless and manipulative.\n\nI know I sound like a mess, but I\u2019m tired of living like this. Any advice is appreciated\u2014even if it\u2019s harsh. I don\u2019t know if this is just me or something common with other autistic people but I think I might just be a manipulative individual.",

Nothing sticks for long and I\u2019m plagued with financial instability (actually 4k in credit card debt currently- and I live super frugal too and do everything to cut costs)\n\nI just can\u2019t keep up the mask and the tasks that long, usually 6-18 months or so.\n\nWorst part is it\u2019s not just jobs, it\u2019s friends and hobbies.

There\u2019s just nothing that interests me or that I\u2019m good at I can see myself doing in the long term.\n\nIn and out of therapy whole life which has never really helped, currently on Wellbutrin (apparent I\u2019m one of the 3 people it kinda works for lol)\n\nI\u2019ve had the bad bad bad thoughts since I was 7 years old. If this is what life is, I just don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want a future I don\u2019t want a family I don\u2019t even really want a lot of money or a career but I need that to survive \n\nI\u2019ve broken 13 bones, dropped out of college, and my longest relationship cheated on me. And capped out a couple years ago at 300lbs (actually lost 60lbs and am going to keep going down but it hasn\u2019t made me feel any better, just pissed I let it get so bad in the first place.) My entire 20s have been miserable, hell my teens weren\u2019t great either\n\nTrying to do art or music just makes me want to physically trash my entire apartment, I know these things take practice but last time I tried to draw I clenched my teeth so hard I chipped a tooth. Tried teaching myself guitar and in just my first couple days I had an entire episode and drank myself to sleep for a month straight (thank goodness I\u2019m a happy drunk). Apparently I\u2019m a half decent writer but I hate everything I\u2019ve ever made- even if people like it I get weirdly angry and depressed and have to leave\n\nThat\u2019s nothing thing: even though I put out positivity into the world, I outright despise receiving it. Being celebrated makes me want to disappear forever.\n\nI\u2019m just\u2026 done. Even Accomplishing short term goals does nothing for cause of the adhd.\n\nSo to hell with it, I hope you all accomplish your dreams! Find your paths! And make the most of it all!\n\n",

I usually get up around 4am because I'm afraid to go back to sleep. I'm in therapy and have a great mental health team. I've tried ssris, prazocin, and now Xanax.

My finals are going on and I stayed up until 11:30pm when i heard my sis and mom fighting in the room. My mom came crying to me saying that my sis pulled my mom's hair and her head hurts so bad because my mom asked me sis to turn off the light when my mom wanted to sleep after a tiring day. She came to me asking me to stop studying, turn off the light and just as I turned off the light. My sis came in apologizing to my mom in a very devilish way. I've had enough. My mom directly said to my sis that some dog pulled her hair referring to my sis but she replied \"oh did she (me) pull your hair? Is she the dog? Is she the pretend good daughter loser??' And kept saying shit. I said to her we both know that it's her and it's not normal. I asked her why would she hurt my mom and she's like oh did you hurt mom?\" I said to her it's not normal and she's insane and she threatened to kill me. With a knife on her hand. I kept arguing asking how she can hurt mom because she's all I have and my mom never been too strict and always supportive.  Then after some more fighting, my sis and mom left to their room and started to fight more. My sis barged out and took my valuable items (I sleep in hall and borrowed a cupboard from my mom) and she broke everything and throwing everything and breaking everything like a crazy patient. I broke down and came out my house and sitting in the apartment stairs right now..I'm extremely tired with my finals going around and I had alot of friendship break ups recently.

I've been debating asking my therapist to recommend me to a psychiatrist so that I can get meds to help me but I'm also terrified. I'm scared of the long term health implications. I'm scared of side effects. I'm scared of going through the \"trial and error\" phase of medication. I used to take Zoloft when I was around 13 but it made me feel numb, suicidal and aggressive. I also developed tics from it to which I had to take another medication to combat it. They didn't help and I hated how they made me feel, so I cut them cold turkey and haven't taken anything since. I'm at a point with my mental health where I'm considering taking meds again. Does anyone have any advice for how to not be afraid? Or any words of how depression medication has helped you or someone you know? ",

However recently, as she\u2019s gotten married and has talked about having children soon, I\u2019ve noticed some of her habits have become worse and worse and I am honestly really afraid for my future nieces/ nephews. I know this might sound horrible, but I was just wondering if someone else has ever been in this position?\n\nFor background information, I love her of course. And I would never do anything to sabotage her having children, or even say anything. But I\u2019m so afraid of watching everything play out like it always has since I was a kid. \n\nMy sister hasn\u2019t really been diagnosed with anything that we know of, but she\u2019s had violent outbursts ever since we were children. And I was just informed that these outbursts have followed into her adulthood. She also has never admitted any wrong doing, like ever, for anything in her entire life. Even if she said the sky was green today, you\u2019d have to agree with her or she\u2019d throw a fit and belittle you. Her emotions are never consistent, one day she\u2019ll throw a fit over something you\u2019d do, the next day you\u2019ll do the same thing and she\u2019ll copy you and love it. I could never get through to her even for something little. Her inconsistency and outbursts really worry me and I don\u2019t want the cycle of a broken families to continue honestly, and I don\u2019t want any of it to weight on me. I know it\u2019s really not my place, but I can\u2019t help but worry. My mom says she might get better when she has the kids, but that seems like a recipe for disaster imo. Does anyone know how to cope? It would be greatly appreciated to just hear different perspectives. Thank you.",

Unfortunately she was unable to help me either, but at least she confirmed it\u2019s not my fault and I\u2019m just an unusual case for most therapists.  \nI really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do in times like these when my brain has too much pain. I feel like I\u2019m running out of places to talk about these things. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m running out of things to talk about, since I just keep repeating the same things over and over and only hear the same solutions, which I\u2019ve tested out thoroughly already. There\u2019s no point in talking about any of it anymore. I\u2019m unfixable and noone knows how to show support either, not even mental health professionals. I feel so alone. ",

Theyre pretty nice, and sometimes it would also give me\u2026.arousal, but i dont really mind it.\nBut anytime this happens, it triggers my intrusive sexual thoughts and it ruins the vibe yk. I dont really like it when it does that. It mostly makes me feel uncomfortable or even disgusted ( sometimes even feeling pale ). \n\nThese thoughts would also pop out of nowhere or just randomly. And its very annoying. \n\nSometimes it even makes me doubt abt my sexuality, and would literally be scared that im just in denial and just pretended or forced to hate them ( which apparently was true ) to the point that i post shit like this. \n\n\nAnd ppl on this reddit would usually respond to \u2018\u2019 don\u2019t be ashamed of these thoughts. Its okay to have sexual thoughts, ppl have them \u2018\u2019\n\nYeah, no shit sherlock ( no offense, im just very tired im sorry ). \nIts like you are trying to describe me that water is wet.\n\nLike, YES, i DO know thats its okay to have sexual thoughts. I never said nor did i ever thought they were \u2018\u2019 wrong \u2018\u2019, its just not my cup of tea. And its pretty disturbing imo ( Im sex-repulsed ). But if ppl like it, THEN THEY LIKE IT. \n\nAlso, im not exactly ashamed of these thought. I just feel uncomfortable and mostly disgusted by them.

Its more of a \u2018m BRO WTF, ew\u2026 well i did not enjoy that \u2018\u2019 \n\nBut then OH, its not enough how much i feel abt it, cuz im gonna doubt AGAIN. And literally search on google signs if i am sexually shaming myself AGAIN. \nAnd then come here and search for my problems even though i will never FIND IT. \n\nAnd then my stupid ass will post abt it. And then FINALLY, someone FINALLY told me that i have sexual shame\u2026 FINALLY. Its like winning a reward rn ( and i also feel scared cuz yk\u2026.i dont want to have sexual shame ). But the thing that is making me struggle is, what am i gonna do now. Am i just gonna force myself into thinking these sexual thoughts? I dont want to do this at all, but i dont want to make my sexual shame worse, so ima force myself to Watch porn ig\u2026 or talk to a therapist might be great.\n\nIm just very tired and i really should get some sleep.

I am having extreme anxiety and lots of different issues going on which have been only getting worse. My mom wants me to get a job but I'm terrified of people and think they all want to hurt me, I am terrified of getting sick and I feel like I'm always being watched so I'm almost always tense. \n\nStuff goes on in my mind that I can't even put into words. I don't really believe I'm human. And I'm scared of the doctors and the medicine they have prescribed I fear all it's going to do is make me worse. Sometimes I think their ultimate goal is to drive me to s*icide. I'm so scared of getting sick I scrub my hands until they crack up and bleed.\n\nMy mom is threatening to hit me because I been leaving some splatters of water on the floor. I know I'm disappointing everyone around me. She never has hit me but I just wish she would understand. Maybe she wants me to get sick? I don't know but I'm really not okay and I want to move out so bad but I can barely even think straight I have horrible brain fog and dissociation. I'm scared to leave the house alone. \n\nThey are making me take the pills and I don't necessarily want to take them because this anxiety keeps me safe and I don't want the pills to cause side effects and make me worse. Besides I don't believe I'm human and I don't have mental disorders I'm just trying to protect myself from things I would have never experienced if I wasn't put here. I am back and forth on this belief but right now I truly believe it. \n\nWhat should I do? I'm terrified, I have no goal in life, I barely enjoy anything, I can't think half the time, I'm on autopilot, I'm bullied online,  I don't believe I can function as an adult but everyone is pushing me to and I'm reaching my breaking point. I don't feel safe anywhere in this world. But I'm to scared to die because I'm scared of hell. To scared to live and to scared to die so I'm frozen in place. \n\nThis all is stuff I'm to scared to share but it goes on in my mind daily. I don't want people to think I'm even more crazy and I definitely don't want to be hospitalised. Speaking of hospitalised they are talking sending me and my mom might be calling the doctor and telling them I'm not taking my pill. \n\nI don't know I guess my ultimate goal here is to get my own little apartment somewhere and get an online job then never leave. No germs, I wouldn't bother my family anymore, and I wouldn't need to take pills. I'm just scared I will need a clear mind and to be able to concentrate in order to do a job. I hate this brain fog. \n\n(TW self harm) I cope sometimes by cutting and they said the next time I do that I will be hospitalised. They get very angry and think I'm doing all this to hurt them when I'm not. I been doing it again and I really don't want anyone to find out this time. I just wish someone could understand.\n\nSorry for such a long ass post but I really needed someone to hear this. Most of this I've never shared and I'm sure a lot of it is all in my head. ",

    "selftext": "Hey, if I make any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes I'm sorry I'm both dyslexic and struggling so didn't proof read.\n\n so I'm am a 15 year old girl who has recently (as of July 2024) been diagnosed with both autism and adhd. \n\nAs a bit of context I have had 4 major people in my life die in the span of 4 year one of which being my dad who was an achoholic when I was 7 leading to me forming a codependency with my mum out of fear of abandonment, this has also lead to some amount of anxiety and low mood for pretty much as long as I can remember, however i have been to both counselling and therapy which helped greatly. The past 8-9 months I have been going through what my mental health nurse has speculated was autistic burnout which has morphed into a depression.\n\n I have always been an achiever, the top of not only my class but also my entire school as well as doing many extra curriculars all of which I greatly enjoyed and placed as my sole value however  i couldn't handle the pressure of all that and the self imposed desire to be \"normal\" and forcing myself to be normal.\n\n Slowly but surely I have begun a self isolation and don't talk to my friends, don't see my boyfriend, don't go to school, and I have no energy to study. This has impacted me greatly because my academic achievements are all i say i have and to lose that has certainly added to my depression. \n\nI have to very close cousins who have autism, and it has been especially hard to come to terms with my diagnosis due to that fact, all my life I have been told to give them allowances I was never afforded adding to the pressure to excel and the eventual meltdown I had in July. I am struggling with the fact that my brain and body are at war, I have exams in less than a month and yet I am incapable of doing anything but worry over it because all I do is sit and rot in my bed. I feel like I am already dead, and I kinda want to be. Every night I go to sleep wishing I'd never wake up and every morning i am disappointed when i do. \n\nThe only true support I feel I have is my mum and my therapist (It's through CAMHS so it's not great). My family doesn't believe in mental health with children which is almost worse than not believing in it at all, they think in to young to have anything like that. \n\nMy mum keeps getting mad at me when she says im acting better, I feel as though I'm getting worse just better at hiding it from her. she also says that I'm not trying to get better, and the thing is I'm not even sure she's wrong, I'm so exhausted yet my mind go wild and I can't see anyway out because getting better relie on me but right now I can't relie on me. I can't see a way out of this, I feel I've dug myself into a hole to deep that ill never get back from. \n\nEmotions are hard, people are hard, life is hard\n\nAnything in the comments would be really good, even just to see I'm not alone even though I feel so desperately isolated.",

    "selftext": "I'm 23f, I straight up DONT cry. I'm in college, my peers will talk about crying when they are stressed, crying when they get yelled at, etc. One of my friends said he cries more than once a week. It confuses the hell out of me because the last time I cried, I hadn't cried for over a year before that.\n\nI'm stoic, like my mom is. We were never emotional, never vulnerable. I never felt safe being emotional around any of my four parents (divorced then remarried, which gives me step-parents).\n\nIronically, the only thing in this world that makes me cry is when I think about how much I wish I was closer to my mom. Im not close to any of my parents, but I want to be close to my mom, and only my mom. I strangely feel almost a grief for the relationship I don't have with her. All I have to do to trigger tears is to think the words \"I want my mommy\". \n\nI feel a grief and sadness about the life she was stuck with, from the story I've been able to piece together from the little she told me.\n\n I want to be best friends with her, but I feel like we are in two different worlds, as she performatively follows my step-dads ideas on religion to keep the peace in the house, and I stopped believing in the religions disgusting morals years ago. \n\nIt makes me sad that she needs to protect her peace so badly that she wouldn't let me move into her house years ago when I was 19 and desperately wanted to get out of my dad's house. I almost ended up living out of my car at that time but luckily my BFFs parents let me live with them. She didn't want me and my stepdad arguing and stressing her out.\n\nMy mom, stepdad, and I, have created a tentive understanding in our relationship by just not talking about anything of consequences. We have gotten very skilled at avoiding hard conversations. We are all too emotional and stubborn in our ways. I also threaten that my stepdad will be dead to me if he steps out of line one more time. That threat and his mother living with them keeps him in check (she'll straighten him out real quick if I say the word). \n\nMy step dad and my mom recently told me that I'm welcome to stay at their house after I graduate, which made me sad. They said it while drunk, but they meant it. It made me think, why am I allowed to move in now, and not 4 years ago when I was actually vulnerable and in need of support??\n\nAnyways, circling back to my question. Why is it, that out of every fucked up relationship and circumstance in my life, this is the only thing that makes me cry? Why don't I cry about way more stuff?",

    "selftext": "This may be long so I apologize in advance. I\u2019m (20M) and my girlfriend (19F) have been together for over a year now and have been happy together for that year. She is super amazing and cheerful to be around but has had a bit of a troubled life. She\u2019s lost two uncles before the age of 18, has had other family members be \u201cnot visited\u201d for years on end and some are (were) addicts. She does not seem to be traumatized by it. She\u2019s the oldest of 5 and has a special needs brother. Her parents don\u2019t have \u201cfavorites\u201d but her father clearly shows more admiration and pride for the eldest son. For years she has had panic attacks and really bad anxiety to where it brings her to tears oftentimes. The thing is, her father is a bit, to put it lightly not the most on board with modern medicine and therapeutic practices and has a huge problem with the pharmaceutical industry. He\u2019s not at all a bad guy he genuinely means well for his children and wants the best for them. Her mother does try her best to do what she can but is not able to do much against her father. He only let her go to therapy after she was doing self-____ and didn\u2019t even let her finish therapy before pulling her out claiming it to be a bunch of bs designed to make you think something is wrong with you so companies can sell their products. He believes that meditation and exercise is what she needs but it just doesn\u2019t work for her. He forbids prescription medicine for his children (she\u2019s the oldest at 19 and the youngest is 8 months) because it\u2019s how his brother and his half-brother passed away (OD). She\u2019s undiagnosed (as far as I\u2019m aware of) with panic attacks and GAD. Just lately it has been getting worse and I cannot change this man\u2019s mind and I don\u2019t want to be sneaky and take her to see a therapist behind his back. All I want is the best for her and having her cry almost every night on the phone hurts me a lot and I feel powerless. So I ask the people of Reddit for any guidance. (If you have any questions or need more context don\u2019t be afraid to ask in the comments I tried giving as much as I could here :)",

I have been on and off from therapy during that time. I guess I just want to know what helped others? Idk I am afraid that it won't ever go away I do better for a little bit and better is just surviving. Then I will kind of fall back into feeling awful and recently I've been feeling this same unmotivated deep sadness or apathy. \n\nI tried taking medication again but it literally just made me a lot worse and undid any progress I felt like I had made actually. I had a pretty scary moment where I woke up with severe neck pain after taking lexapro it was the first dose and I felt sick to my stomach. I fell back asleep but the next day my neck was so sore I couldn't even move it around. I was like that for two weeks it is just now coming back to normal. I stopped taking it immediately because that was so terrifying I have never had anything like that happen to me before.  I feel like if I brought this up with anyone they would think I'm being paranoid but it was so painful I wanted to cry and I felt so terribly physically and mentally right after and in the weeks following.\n\n  \nI just want to know like what helps. Does anyone else suffer from depression and meds just do not help? They always just seem to make me feel way worse and swing me into a depressive state. \n\n  \n",

It was wrong of me but I read their messages as was driving myself mad with paranoia and had a gut feeling that had been going on for a good 5 months and couldn't stand it any more. And what i read was awful. \n\nBit of background when he first took her on i warned him this would happen as her FB post looking for a mechanic just screamed a thirsty bitch what wasn't just wanting a mechanic. At this time funnily enough I told him how it was going to play out and it did, just worse.\n\nI used to go with him to work and then come September my body wouldn't allow me to pass urine and so had a catheter for nearly 2 weeks. During that time I stopped going with him as was embarrassed and self conscious incase it filled while we were out and then it was really noticeable. Anyway come to nearly having it out and he tells me I can't go with him any more as this particular person said it looks bad on the company etc. I told him then that she was only saying that as then im out the way and she gets him alone. Was reassured I was wrong.\n\nThey hugged on the 11th of October and he told her he enjoyed it. 1 week later he gets home from being at hers and he's having a severe allergic reaction and ended up in hospital from it. In the messages between them it was because that day she had had her tongue down his throat and she eats peanuts.  Dec 1st she messaged him asking if she put him off her the last time they had sex and for him to answer honestly and he said of course not. Between then and now he'd been telling me he had work to do there but not every time he went was he working as again was in the messages. When I had to go back to my parents for my dad's sentencing day he spent the weekend at her house. He was trying to get her to let him move in with her etc and told her ill just tell her (me) that I don't need her any more. There's more but it'll take too long.\n\n\nAnyways since reading it all, I've been going through so many extreme emotions, obsessing over it linking things i read to things he told me and how things didn't add up and now i know why, i dread going to sleep as most nights im having nightmares, he played songs from one of his play lists and the tears and rage started because he probably played that playlist while he was with her. I've restricted my food intake massively because I need to be skinnier and prettier to the point I've looked into how much different surgeries would cost. All it takes is to go that side of town and it all comes flooding back in. What has she got that I don't? What little self esteem and confidence i did have has gone. I'm totally broken.\n\nSo is it possible to get ptsd from being cheated on when it lasted a quarter of our relationship?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all, good day,\n\nI\u2019m 36 and have been married for 7 years. During my 20s-30s, I was sexually active with ex-partners and never experienced erection/climax issues. Before marriage, I didn\u2019t have intercourse with my inexperienced wife.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, I had been involved with more experienced partners/prostitutes before marriage, which heightened my sexual expectations. My wife was hesitant and timid about sex, which made intimacy challenging. During this time + currently, I rely heavily on masturbation and pornography (averaging twice daily), which has since escalated to rough contents (scat, spy etc...).\n\n\n\nOver time, my wife and I developed better communication about sex, including watching porn together and discussing kinks. She is a wonderful partner, and we now want to start a family. However, I struggle with sexual attraction toward her and often need to think about past partners or fantasies to feel aroused. She knows this. We spoke about our gaps on intimacy and want to start fresh.\n\n\n\nI also find it difficult to climax during intercourse with her, though she says she enjoys our intimacy. I suspect my pornography consumption may have impacted my libido or performance. We use sex toys, lubes etc, but I never get that lovely feeling like I had with others.\n\nI\u2019m seeking advice on how to rebuild sexual attraction toward my wife and improve our intimacy while addressing these challenges.",

When this occurs she has meds to take but sometimes she doesn't take them and once it gets too bad she forgets where they are or she's too afraid to take them.\n\nShe knows she needs help and has asked for it.  She can't drive and friends are not always available.  What she would like is to make sure she gets taken to a hospital to get straightened out.  \n\nJust to be clear, she wants to get help when psychosis sets in so we're not facing a situation where that's not the case.  What we've (family) done in the past is call in a welfare check with the local police.  And, they have taken her to the hospital before.  I'm afraid though that that's not a good long term solution.  Eventually they will tire of doing the welfare check, at least that's my guess.\n\nMy question is:  Does anyone have any suggestions for who to contact to ensure she can get to a hospital when needed?   I live very far away and can't be that person.  The area is Beaufort County in South Carolina.  Are there any organization who help folks out with mental health issues of that magnitude when they occur?   I'm not sure if the local mental health agency provides that level of care regardless of time of day.  Ideas are welcome!  Thanks!",

I hate how unstable I feel. I can wake up feeling anxious, spend my day calming down only to break down again to feel fine in the evening. These breakdowns involve (what feels like) endless negative thought spirals, about how I'm not good enough, not smart enough, not disciplined enough, and so forth. This is followed by feeling even worse over the amount of self-pity I have for myself and how little I am doing to change anything about it. Then the cycle continues until I am exhausted and slowly start feeling normal again.\n\nMy partner is supportive, but he doesn't understand. He tells me he doesn't understand how I can make little things so big and this question leaves me with only more hopelessness. I feel bad that he has to witness these breakdowns and I wish him a healthier girlfriend.\n\nJust writing this alone makes me cringe, and I'm not exactly sure what I'm hoping to achieve with this post, but I guess I wanted to put it out there.\n\nThank you for reading. <3",

But was playing with six major concussions not from sports, suffered an extremely bad one in my third year, to the point I lost pure cognitive function for a week. I was bleeding out my ears.  I finished up university with degree in kinesiology and was personal training had a lot of clients, been bodybuilding since I was 13. Ended up falling for girl in another province and moved province. 4 months into being here I had something very traumatic happen, and 6 days later was driving with her and had my first ever seizure, totalled my vechile, she was okay only a sprained wrist(I took most of the blow) ended up in coma for 2 and half days but when I woke up lost entire cognitive function, had to learn to walk again, and speak again. Was so bad I had to have nurse help shower me. And top it off she broke up with me because it was too overwhelming. I sat there all alone in the hospital for 3 weeks. It\u2019s been 2 years since and been pursing bodybuilding and blew up on social media, but my seizures have got so bad I have them everyday or every other day. I would try and hold a job and lose it in 3-5 months because of seizures. To point I\u2019m living on disability, and I\u2019m very grateful that I\u2019m on it but feel like a failure so every 3 months I try to get a job and it not lasting because of my health, just feel really bad because I\u2019m extremely hard worker, I put all my effort in social media and treat it like a job, I have big following but don\u2019t have enough to live off, just lot of free clothes and small contracts. Just feel really bad because my cognitive function is getting worse, I have post concussion syndrome and my memory, my speech, my processing speed and I\u2019m extremely sensitive to lights and sounds are getting worse and worse.

But after I had took an astronomy class my senior year of HS, I then realized how little I knew about everything and went down a spiral of confusion, depression, anxiety, and anger about how much I didn't know. \n\nAnd a lot of it was due to me rubbing every event and moment happening around me off as a gift and message from God. I never studied into anything. Until I started studying science and all my faith was lost. There were too many unanswered questions, so many contradictions... I have my reasons to leave. \n\nBut it angers me to see anyone putting 100% of their belief that God is real, and is sentient, and cares about what humans wear, eat, say, and believe.  (Like I said, I have my reasons on leaving.) But I don't want to be angry at them. I understand it's just what they believe and it makes them happy. But how can someone go all their life not asking a science related question and realize that what's being read in that book was written by man. It's a story. How could someone base all their knowledge about how this world came to be and is the way it is now off of these stories with the limited answers and evidence given and live normally? \n\nI'm not asking anybody to answer these questions I'm asking, but it's just questions I ask myself which lead me to believe that maybe I need help? It absolutely isn't my business what anyone else's beliefs are, but it bothers me that their knowledge is so small. I want to see the growth in others, but clinging on to a belief likes this holds you back so much. I don't want to be angry, but it just bothers me so much. \nDo I need mental help?",

They may avoid carbonated drinks, spicy food, and alcohol to ensure they don\u2019t get hiccups.\n\nMany with singultophobia can feel alone because there is a lack of community.

I always thought i was weak because that\u2019s what I heard starting from my childhood, and i never really defended myself, just brush it off with jokes and laugh. That\u2019s basically becoming my coping mechanisms, but my last 4 year relationship broke me beyond that I can handle. I became moody, irritable, easily bored by people even if it\u2019s a relationship, I suspect the bad things happen, and when this happens I completely detached from that person because I don\u2019t want to be hurt, but because of this I can\u2019t feel true happiness, and it\u2019s just making me more sour, cuz i still remember times when I was truly happy(sadly mostly not because of peoples, rather games and some achievements, but it\u2019s also don\u2019t happening anymore).

I tried pills (scippa, helping with my serotonin, keeping my mind and panic attacks at bay), i went to psychiatrist, psychologist, I tried to be alone but I hated it because I was mostly alone, but I couldn\u2019t really handle relationships because my trust issues and because I constantly scanning my partner when she is genuine or not, and I can\u2019t break this endless spiraling abyss.

His life did a 180, he stopped seeing friends, dropped out of college, and spends a majority of his days in bed. He is irritable 24/7, lies often (so I never really know how he's doing), has extremely low self esteem, and seems to not care about anything. Saying that he has been lost is an understatement. He is my little brother, and I am in the mental health field but as his older sister, I worry about him tirelessly. I have tried to force him to get help, tried to force him to do therapy, (he was only in it for a few months), tried to have him take meds (he refused), but nothing seems to help. I sometimes question if he's on drugs, because his behavior is bizarre (excessive lying, complete isolation, slurred speech sometimes on the phone)... I've asked him outright and he denies it. My parents are old school and don't understand the extent of it. He has opened up to me only once in the past, and called me one night in tears 2 years ago, telling me he often thinks of ending his life and doesn't know why he has these thoughts. Ever since that night, he says he \"doesn't have these thoughts anymore\". To say I worry about him is an understatement. I have a deep sense of love and responsibility for him, and feel like I've tried so many things but nothing is helping. If you've ever been in this situation, what helped? What hasn't? I feel so stuck and would move mountains if it meant that he was okay...",

For over a year now he has started expressing that he doesn\u2019t want to live anymore \u2014 not in a dramatic way, but in a deeply exhausted, hopeless tone that really scares me.\n\nI can see how much pain he is in, both physically and emotionally. I try to be there for him, but I often feel completely helpless since I can understand why he doesn\u2018t want to do it anymore. I don\u2019t know how to give him even a little bit of hope.\n\nHave any of you been in a similar situation, or supported someone going through something like this? What can I say or do to make him feel seen, heard, and maybe a little less hopeless? I just want him to feel like there\u2019s still something worth holding on to.\n\nAny advice would mean a lot. Thank you.\n",

I spent my entire childhood and teenager years suffering  from OCD, depression and lots of physical pain to only receive help to search for treatment after losing my mind during a cancer treatment when I was 23.

I'm always in pain, always switching medication that stops working for depression and OCD and I can't keep a job or even find one.

    "selftext": "(TW: childhood and him talking about sexual stuff to me when i was 9 adding this just in case)  \n\nWhen I was younger, about nine years old in my tuition class for Math, a boy had started telling me about sex, and procreation. He was a few years older than I was, I don\u2019t recall his age exactly but I think he was in 9th when I was in 5th. He would vividly describe what sex was to me, specifically how it worked. One instance I remember was him trying to describe it whenever the teacher would leave and I had covered my ears because I did not want to hear, I did not believe it, but somewhere I had started too. \n\nI remember when I was very sad and disturbed about it, I don\u2019t recall why I was, however I do feel from that age I would have vivid imaginations about it. The timeline in which the imaginations had started is a bit fuzzy, I don\u2019t know if it was after or before my period, but I am inclining towards after. I got my period in the summer of 2016 in August, before I started wearing bras I remember correctly, obviously, before my period started they had started developing and I had come back from India and started my period in August. \n\nIn August he had come over to meet my cousin brother and he was not there, and the other was a sleep. So he has asked me if i wanted to play a game (I think a card game, I can be wrong) and my cleaner was cleaning and he did not shut the door, so he (the boy) asked me to shut the door and he started saying (i can be wrong maybe my mind is filling in the gaps) you have started your period, I said \u201cNo, I have not\u201d (paraphrased) and he is like yeah you have, your breasts have developed, and at the point I do not know what happened but my mother, cleaner, cousin entered the room and said do not close the door and I am guessing he left after that. \n\nI did not really understand everything at that age but it did leave me wondering what sex was and I got exposed to that at a young age, it started from imagination to videos, and i think maybe in 6th-7th grade it was erotic stories on WattPad, I only ever understand what all this was once I was older in 9th-10th grade. Thinking about it again has made me a bit sad, angry, frustrated that I was exposed to something that young with no choice.",

    "selftext": "So, I'm a teen boy who has had sexual attraction for boys since I was in middle-school, since the very beginning of my sexual desires development. I was still convinced of being straight for a long time and was looking for romantical relationships with girls since a year ago, but then I discovered the gay world and it aligned perfectly with me. \n\nFor months, I was a gay rebel against the homophobia of society. I was really happy and looking for a romantical relationship with boys, and I was still highly sexually attracted to boys. I felt like those ideals were perfectly fit for me.\n\nHowever, I started to acknowledge the homophobia of my family too, and once I wanted to come out of the closet to my classmates and confess to the boy I liked, I was met with shame. They acted all supportive, but they were/are talking shit behind my back. I genuinely trusted all of them. My family adds to the situation too: \"You'll be the family's disappointment if everyone finds out!\" \"They are the devil's work! It's not supposed to be that way!\" Were shoved down my throat when I was the most vulnerable, and I couldn't even trust my classmates anymore. All of these pressures together cracked my confidence open, and led me to where I am now.(I also had a neurotic attraction for that boy, full of jealousy, etc...)\n\nLet me describe my current situation, which I personally describe as a hetero-ocd:\n\nI very,very often feel extremely anxious. I fear that my own sexuality is a lie, I fear being actually straight. I fear that all of my good times I had as a \"gay person\" were just illusions, and I'm just straight with a desire of belonging. I feel homosexuality does not fit so well for me anymore, but neither does heterosexuality, because I have never felt romantical/sexual attraction for a woman in a long time, and currently not do. I have always watched gay porn, but I'm more interested in straight one at the moment, so that makes me more insecure. \n\nIn fact, I'm insecure of all I do. \"Is that my real self?\" \"Are these homosexual feelings genuine, or is it because you want more dominating girls to take care of you, but you think guys offer more dignity because society says so, so you pick guys instead of women?---> THIS MEANS YOUR ATTRACTION TO GUYS IS A LIE!!\" are thoughts I had a month ago, when I was the most vulnerable, which I never had in my entire life.\n\nI cannot seek professional help, what can I do about it? I'm not comfortable with anything, and all I do is think about this problem all day, without resolving it definitely. Is this OCD?",

In short: I\u2019m directionless, lost, and trapped in a cycle of: something bad happens (bad grade on an exam in college, me being spotted sitting on my phone during a church youth meeting, etc.), parents get angry and we talk (more like monologues as I can\u2019t say anything to defend myself), I start beating myself up, listing many positives on how my family would be happier if I was dead/didn\u2019t exist, I get over it after a bit, and the cycle repeats.\n\nNow, for the explanation: I\u2019m a guy who\u2019s almost 20, live in a christian household, attend church, almost 8 years in the US, was born in Ukraine. I\u2019m doing college, trying to get a Computer Science degree. Over the past year or two, I\u2019ve been feeling really lost in life. I have no real motivation, no goals, no direction I want to go, I\u2019m just\u2026 stuck, drifting through life. Even though I\u2019m doing the degree, I\u2019m doing it just to have *some* kind of direction, but even that I can\u2019t do right. I don\u2019t have the best grades, I dropped 2 classes over 2 quarters, which resulted in my financial aid suspension at the time of writing this. All I ever do is sit in my room for hours on end, either playing games or watching YouTube. I had other hobbies, like guitar, whittling, reading, but I just dropped them over time. All I ever do is escape from this life, feeling hopeless for my future and just play games to get away from that feeling, and feel some kind of purpose, some direction, something I can do. \nAnd\u2026 it hurts. I want to change, I want to have purpose, I want to have goals\u2026 but all of that is denied by the thoughts of it being a failure or it being too insignificant. I\u2019ve tried going to a therapist for help, twice, but those attempts didn\u2019t really go anywhere.\n\nNow, some of you would say: \u201cWell, if you\u2019re  christian, why won\u2019t you turn to God about it, so that he could help?\u201d. It\u2019s a valid question, but I just\u2026 can\u2019t. My mindset has gotten to the point of constant undervaluing of myself. I constantly think that I\u2019m just not worth the attention or effort, that all of emotions, efforts, time, and energy is wasted on me. And in the context of God, it\u2019s even worse. I constantly think that God\u2019s love is wasted on me, that Jesus\u2019 death for my sins is wasted on me. That the best outcome for me is for my family to go to heaven, while I rot in hell, and turn to ash\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t even think I\u2019ll even survive alone in this world. Constantly my mind is filled with scenarios of how I would fail to do basic adult things, like paying rent, doing taxes, having a stable income. How I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to live, and even if I could, I would be just living paycheck to paycheck, in this cycle of barely having enough money. How I would inevitably be homeless, turning to drugs and OD-ing in some ditch or under a bridge, or just be driven insane by the monotony of everything and just\u2026 ending it. And with how the economy is going right now, it certainly doesn\u2019t help.\n\nI\u2019m probably at my lowest point of my life right now. I can\u2019t grow up, I constantly play games to escape, I\u2019m not even a real Christian, I don\u2019t do anything to change with the amount of mental blocks I have, and a HUGE disappointment to my parents, no doubt\u2026 \nI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nIf you\u2019re read all of that, I\u2019m thankful for that, but at the same time, I apologize for wasting your time and making your day a bit worse. Have a great day, you\u2019ll certainly achieve great things!\n\n\n",

He has been doing much better and will be discharged soon to an intensive outpatient program, but he is definitely not back at baseline. He has a very large support system, but we also have concerns on how to best help our friend. No official diagnosis, but there is a family history of schizophrenia.\n\nOur biggest concern is that our friend is showing interest in Christianity and reaching out to old friends/romantic interests. He has never had any interest in religion so this concerns us. He had a pretty bad break up earlier last year and during his psychosis, he would be in denial of the break up and reach out to old romantic interests. At the end of the day, he is an adult and he may have developed an interest in religion, so we are having a hard time finding the balance between protecting him and allowing him to be independent.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, even if it is general advice on ways to support our friend while they go through the outpatient program!",

So I\u2019m just going to write the main problems and hope someone has any advice. \n- started self harming at 15, stopped at 22 but ended up getting addicted to vaping instead, which I desperately want to stop but I think it\u2019s just another crutch now.\n- I CANNOT, talk about my feelings or have uncomfortable conversations honestly in person/on the phone, the words physically don\u2019t come out even if I want them to. \n- I loose friendships because I guess I forget about them and don\u2019t reply because i don\u2019t see them irl. \n- I feel an underlying level of stress all the time. Like there\u2019s so much that needs doing and I\u2019m always somewhat aware.\n- I\u2019ll know I need to do something but instead just sit there, scroll on my phone or do something irrelevant and keep counting the hours I have left to do it thinking there\u2019s enough and waiting till the next half hour or hour until I\u2019m staying up late to complete deadlines.\n- I lose everything, to the point it\u2019s becoming a problem at work and it takes me ages looking for things I need to do my job.\n- I\u2019m tired all the time. By the time I\u2019m finished at work and home, if I lie in bed I\u2019m asleep in a minute. \n- I really struggle with the thought of hurting peoples feelings that I\u2019ll do things or not say things that make me feel unhappy so I don\u2019t upset them.\n- Sometimes I think I don\u2019t love people the way that other people do and instead they\u2019re just important people rather than having the feeling of love. \n- I feel like I conversation vomit sometimes and when I get home again i regret half the things I\u2019ve said and stress about how they\u2019re going to come back to bite me. \n",
